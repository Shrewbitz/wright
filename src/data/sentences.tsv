1417	eng	I need to ask you a silly question.
1418	eng	I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
1419	eng	I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up "Viagra" in Wikipedia.
1420	eng	Can it be phrased in another way?

1429	eng	You never have class or what?!
1430	eng	I will play Sudoku then instead of continuing to bother you.
1431	eng	Where is the problem?
1432	eng	I can only wait.
1433	eng	It's not much of a surprise, is it?

1447	eng	You can probably guess what happens though.
1448	eng	Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
1449	eng	What other options do I have?
1450	eng	I am not much of a traveller.
1451	eng	I have nothing better to do.
1452	eng	I can't explain it either.
1453	eng	Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
1454	eng	Seriously though, episode 21 made me almost cry while laughing.

1456	eng	How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
1458	eng	It's not something anyone can do.
1459	eng	I don't know if I still have it.

1465	eng	Therein lies the problem.
1466	eng	How do you find food in outer space?

1468	eng	Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
1469	eng	Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
1470	eng	I utterly despise formal writing!
1471	eng	Foreign people intrigue me.
1472	eng	Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
1473	eng	What keeps you up so late?
1474	eng	You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
1475	eng	I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
1476	eng	You're not fast enough.
1477	eng	Life is hard, but I am harder.
1478	eng	Bearing can be unbearable.
1479	eng	Stop it! You're making her feel uncomfortable!
1480	eng	Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
1481	eng	Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
1482	eng	I don't speak Japanese.
1483	eng	This is a pun.
1484	eng	Nobody understands me.
1485	eng	I learned to live without her.
1486	eng	It's useless to keep on thinking any more.
1487	eng	I have too many things on my mind these days.
1488	eng	I just wanted to check my email.
1489	eng	Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
1490	eng	You can't expect me to always think of everything!
1491	eng	I suppose that behind each thing we have to do, there's something we want to do...
1492	eng	You really don't have the right priorities!
1493	eng	Don't expect others to think for you!
1494	eng	You never have time for important things!
1495	eng	It's no use pretending to make me believe that I believe things you don't believe!
1496	eng	It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
1497	eng	I'm so dumb... I'm trying to explain things to you that I don't understand myself.
1498	eng	Stop seeing me as a "normal" person!
1499	eng	Are you referring to me?
1500	eng	There will always be things I will never learn, I don't have eternity before me!
1501	eng	It can't be!
1502	eng	I wish I could care more about my grades but it seems that, at a certain point of my life, I decided they wouldn't be so important anymore.

1518	eng	"Thank you for helping me." "Don't mention it."
1519	eng	Someday I'll run like the wind.
1520	eng	"She likes music." "So do I."
1521	eng	Please don't cry.
1522	eng	Let me know if there is anything I can do.
1523	eng	It may be that the happiness awaiting us is not at all the sort of happiness we would want.

1686	eng	I hate those spiders. They're always there to freak me out when I'm cleaning.
1687	eng	So annoying... Now I get a headache whenever I use the computer!
1688	eng	It's so hot that you could cook an egg on the hood of a car.

2137	eng	If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.
2138	eng	The essence of liberty is mathematics.
2139	eng	His story was too ridiculous for anyone to believe.
2140	eng	How many hours of sleep do you need?
2141	eng	Each person is a world.
2142	eng	I have French nationality but Vietnamese origins.
2143	eng	It's very frustrating to try to find your glasses when you can't see anything without glasses.
2144	eng	Do you think mankind will someday colonize the Moon?
2145	eng	What famous songs do you wish you had composed, and why?
2146	eng	I'm going to buy myself a new camera, digital this time.
2147	eng	I'm crazy about you.
2148	eng	I don't know what is worse.
2149	eng	Life in prison is worse than the life of an animal.
2150	eng	I am proud to be a part of this project.
2151	eng	Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees.
2152	eng	Who buys this type of art?

2160	eng	I created a shortcut on the desktop.
2161	eng	I want an MP3 player!
2162	eng	My brother is very important. At least he thinks he is.
2163	eng	While eating a pizza he was annoying his sister.
2164	eng	At this rate, we're not likely to be done before the end of the week.
2165	eng	I guess my view on friendship is pretty bleak because I've never really had to rely on anyone for anything.

2167	eng	No, I cannot let you in, there's one person too many.
2168	eng	Where are you?

2383	eng	Why aren't you coming with us?
2384	eng	I can't say the opposite.
2385	eng	Why are you telling me about hippos all of the sudden? I don't see the connection between that and your twelve red goldfishes.

2463	eng	Who said that? It's totally wrong!
2464	eng	When I was a child, I would spend hours reading alone in my room.
2465	eng	Wolves won't usually attack people.
2466	eng	"Can somebody help me?" "I will."

6133	eng	I can't believe my eyes.
6135	eng	I couldn't say when exactly in my life it occurred to me that I would be a pilot someday.
6136	eng	An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
6138	eng	She has always done her best to make their life easier.
6140	eng	I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.

12621	eng	Just a minute.
13034	eng	You asked after her? What did she say?

15835	eng	You need only ask him to pay the debt.
15836	eng	You told him that he should have a reward.
15837	eng	I don't think you can gain his ear.
15838	eng	You ought to thank him.
15839	eng	You have only to give him a little help.

17425	eng	Your idea cannot be brand new. I heard about it from another source last year.
17426	eng	Your idea is definitely worth thinking about.
17427	eng	I will dry your T-shirt.
17428	eng	Your T-shirt will dry soon.
17429	eng	I regret that I told you.
17430	eng	I have something to tell you.
17431	eng	I was almost afraid to talk to you.
17432	eng	I have some good news for you.
17433	eng	I will find you a good doctor.
17434	eng	I want you to go to the post office.
17435	eng	You can count on the $3,000 I have promised you.
17436	eng	I'll make you a model plane.
17437	eng	I will forgive him out of consideration.
17438	eng	I will forgive him out of consideration for you.
17439	eng	There's a phone call for you from Akemi.
17440	eng	I want you to read this book.
17441	eng	Didn't I lend you some books? I'm sure I did.
17442	eng	You took the words right out of my mouth.
17443	eng	What you need is, in a word, patience.
17444	eng	All you need is to get a driver's license.
17445	eng	I will tell you a secret.
17446	eng	I have a message for you from her.
17447	eng	You can't have understood what he said.
17448	eng	I feel for you.
17449	eng	I cannot help you, not but that I pity you.
17450	eng	I'll boil you the beans.
17451	eng	I refuse to be treated like a slave by you.
17452	eng	Your telegram arrived just as I was about to telephone you.
17453	eng	You are wanted on the phone.
17454	eng	I couldn't call you; the telephone was out of order.
17455	eng	I must offer you an apology for coming late.
17456	eng	I'll lend it to you.
17457	eng	I look around but it's you I can't replace.
17458	eng	You shall have a nice present.
17459	eng	Do you know good from evil?
17460	eng	We'll give you your revenge.
17461	eng	Dozens of letters are awaiting you.
17462	eng	I'll make you a new suit.
17463	eng	Let me give you a bit of advice.
17464	eng	I will never forget seeing you.
17465	eng	I ordered you to get out.
17466	eng	I was going to write to you, but I was too busy.
17467	eng	Who is that girl waving to you?
17468	eng	I'll teach you how to drive a car.
17469	eng	I would like you to go instead of me.
17470	eng	I'll lend you my notebook.
17471	eng	I'm adamant that you should go.
17472	eng	I can only say that I agree with you.
17473	eng	I want you to go.
17474	eng	I have been reflecting on what you said to me.
17475	eng	I wanted to show it to you.
17476	eng	I am counting on you to deliver the opening address.
17478	eng	I waited outside on the chance of seeing you.
17479	eng	I'm very glad to see you.
17481	eng	I am looking forward to seeing you.
17482	eng	It's always delightful to see you.
17483	eng	To see you is always a great pleasure.
17485	eng	I was chagrined at missing you.
17486	eng	How I've missed you!
17487	eng	I'll tell you how to swim.
17488	eng	I would like you to come with me.
17490	eng	There is a piece of good news for you.
17491	eng	You are in part responsible for it.
17492	eng	You ought to have seen it.
17493	eng	I want you to work harder.
17494	eng	I want to see you again.
17495	eng	I'm leaving it to you.
17496	eng	You have a bright future.
17497	eng	He couldn't be good for you.
17498	eng	You have no cause for anger.
17500	eng	You've got nothing to complain of.
17501	eng	You shall want for nothing.
17502	eng	I feel indebted to you for your help during my illness.
17503	eng	You have knowledge and experience as well.
17504	eng	What seems simple to you seems complex to me.
17505	eng	I take my hat off to you.
17506	eng	I want you to be the next Soseki.
17507	eng	You have as much right as everyone else.
17508	eng	You have a tendency to talk too fast.
17509	eng	Life lies in front of you.
17510	eng	Don't you have a sense of justice?
17512	eng	You have many caring friends.
17513	eng	You are very trying to me sometimes.
17514	eng	I expect you to be punctual.
17515	eng	You got me!
17516	eng	Can't you understand the pain of your parents?
17518	eng	There is nothing wrong with you.
17519	eng	You have a gift for music.
17520	eng	I can't lie to you.
17521	eng	I can't hide the fact from you.
17522	eng	You make me feel so guilty.
17523	eng	I've given up on you!
17524	eng	You have the advantage of a good education.
17525	eng	I expect you to work harder.
17526	eng	There are few high-ranking positions left open for you.
17527	eng	You are entitled to try once again.
17528	eng	You are hopeless.
17529	eng	You have a good friend in me.
17530	eng	I bear no grudge against you.
17531	eng	I'm afraid this job is too much for you.
17532	eng	I expect you know all about it.
17533	eng	You have no business doing it.
17534	eng	You deserve the prize.
17535	eng	You have no right to say so.
17536	eng	I take my hat off to you!
17537	eng	I blush for you.
17538	eng	Green suits you.
17539	eng	I am disgusted with you.
17540	eng	I can't thank you enough.
17542	eng	You seem to be insensible of their good intentions.
17543	eng	You have no right to oppose our plan.
17544	eng	All you can do is to wait.
17545	eng	I can't keep up with you.
17546	eng	I'd like to talk with you in private.
17547	eng	I have a very sore arm where you hit me.
17548	eng	How can you say that?
17549	eng	You should have seen it.
17551	eng	I'll stand behind you if you are going to do it.
17552	eng	I guess that you can't do it.
17553	eng	We want you to sing the song.
17554	eng	I hope you have brains enough to see the difference.
17555	eng	Didn't I tell you so?
17556	eng	When you put it so strongly, I can't say I don't agree.
17557	eng	I'm anxious to see you.
17558	eng	You shall have a reward.
17560	eng	I'll give you this pendant.
17561	eng	I'll give you this camera.
17562	eng	I'll give you this money.
17563	eng	Never did I dream of meeting you here.
17564	eng	It is quite a surprise to see you here.
17565	eng	I little dreamed of seeing you here.
17566	eng	You play the guitar quite like a professional, don't you?
17567	eng	Let me give you some advice.
17568	eng	I'll treat you.
17569	eng	I have a nice present to give you.
17570	eng	Can you do that?
17571	eng	I never see you but I think of my brother.
17572	eng	I owe you ten dollars.
17573	eng	A thousand yen is owed to you.
17574	eng	You should not play a joke on me.
17575	eng	Do your work in your own way.
17576	eng	I thought you'd be the last person to do such a thing.
17577	eng	If I were you, I'd be able to succeed.
17578	eng	You can make it! Go for it. I'll stand by you.
17579	eng	You deserve to succeed.
17580	eng	You could get into the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest drinker.
17581	eng	I can't think of life without you.
17583	eng	It's not the time but the will that you lack.
17584	eng	I have no more time to talk with you.
17588	eng	You and I are good friends.
17589	eng	You and I are the same age.
17591	eng	Is it right that you and I should fight?
17592	eng	Beside you, I'm only a beginner at this game.
17593	eng	What's your relation with him?
17594	eng	I am not to blame any more than you are.
17595	eng	He, just like you, is a good golfer.
17596	eng	I as well as you am to blame.
17597	eng	I am not excited any more than you are.
17598	eng	I as well as you was late for school yesterday.
17599	eng	I share your idea.
17600	eng	I bought the same shirt as yours.
17601	eng	He is no more a fool than you are.
17602	eng	If only I could speak English as fluently as you!
17603	eng	You and I are very good friends.
17604	eng	There is a fundamental difference between your opinion and mine.
17605	eng	Either you or I have to go there.
17606	eng	It is hard to distinguish you from your brother.
17607	eng	I feel relaxed with you.
17608	eng	I'll take my chances with you.
17609	eng	I'd love to go with you to the show, but I'm flat broke.
17610	eng	I'd like to go with you, but as it is I can't.
17611	eng	I'd like to go to the seaside with you.
17612	eng	I wish I could go to the party with you.
17613	eng	It is a great pleasure being with you.
17614	eng	I beg to differ, as I disagree with your analysis of the situation.
17615	eng	It pains me to disagree with your opinion.
17616	eng	Listen, um, I was wondering, what are you and Molly doing tonight?
17617	eng	You and I are good friends, but we have little in common.
17618	eng	I'm leaving you tomorrow.
17619	eng	I often think about the place where I met you.
17620	eng	I would like to go to the concert with you.
17621	eng	He'll be sure to smell a rat if I'm with you.
17622	eng	I would prefer to speak to you in private.
17623	eng	You really are hopeless.
17624	eng	You two are the nucleus of the team.
17625	eng	I'll get something to drink for both of you.
17626	eng	I don't like both of you going to such a place.
17627	eng	There is enough bread for all of you.
17628	eng	Divide the cake among you three.
17629	eng	You students are supposed to be diligent.
17630	eng	How old will you be next year?
17631	eng	You had better not start until they arrive.
17632	eng	You should pay attention to his story.
17633	eng	You must not smoke till you grow up.
17634	eng	What are you learning from the teacher?
17635	eng	You are young boys.
17636	eng	You belong to the next generation.
17637	eng	You may swim now.
17638	eng	You are to hand in your assignments by Monday.
17640	eng	You didn't need to hurry.
17641	eng	You must conform to the rules.
17642	eng	All of you did good work.
17643	eng	What do you learn at school?
17646	eng	You should try to be more polite.
17648	eng	All of you are diligent.
17649	eng	You must start at once.
17650	eng	It is imperative for you to act at once.
17651	eng	You must study hard and learn many things.
17652	eng	All you have to do is to learn this sentence by heart.
17654	eng	Are you students at this school?
17655	eng	You have to share the cake equally.
17656	eng	You should know what to read.
17658	eng	Compare your translation with the one on the blackboard.
17659	eng	Compare your sentence with the one on the blackboard.
17660	eng	Who is your teacher?
17661	eng	What was the cause of your quarrel?
17662	eng	I don't approve your decision.
17663	eng	I wonder which of you will win.
17664	eng	There are merits and demerits to both your opinions so I'm not going to decide right away which to support.
17665	eng	Your team is stronger than ours.
17666	eng	Any of you can do it.
17667	eng	Which of you came here first?
17669	eng	Did any of you gentlemen wait on this man?
17670	eng	I think I might join you, but I haven't decided yet.
17671	eng	You've got no alibi for the day of the murder.
17672	eng	Just as you treat me, so I will treat you.
17673	eng	If you're going to the beach, count me in.
17675	eng	When will you complete the preparations?
17676	eng	Boys, don't make any noise.
17677	eng	All you have to do is wait.
17678	eng	Not only you but I also was to blame.
17679	eng	Not only you but also he is ignorant of the truth.
17680	eng	He as well as you likes baseball.
17681	eng	Not only are you wrong, but I am wrong too.
17682	eng	We are both to blame.
17683	eng	You are not the only one responsible for it, I am too.
17685	eng	Only you answered the question.
17687	eng	Only you can carry the bag.
17688	eng	What a memory you have.
17689	eng	You're the only one who can do it.
17690	eng	I'm quite all right if you have no objection to it.
17692	eng	You are the man I've been looking for.
17693	eng	You're the best man for the job.
17694	eng	Don't you move from here.
17696	eng	I hadn't recognized the importance of this document until you told me about it.
17697	eng	I was disappointed at your absence.
17698	eng	Well may you ask why!
17699	eng	I had been to the hospital before you came.
17700	eng	I took it for granted that you would come.
17701	eng	I had no idea that you were coming.
17702	eng	It doesn't matter whether you come or not.
17703	eng	It does not matter to me whether you come or not.
17704	eng	It's a pity that you can't come.
17705	eng	As long as you are here, we might as well begin.
17706	eng	What is it that you want?
17707	eng	I want you.
17708	eng	Either you or your friend is wrong.
17709	eng	I'm amazed by the ease with which you solve the problem.
17710	eng	I will have left when you return.
17711	eng	He will have left here by the time you return.
17712	eng	I will have left here before you return.
17713	eng	I take it from your silence that you are not satisfied with my answer.
17714	eng	We thought we would write out the directions, in case you got lost.
17715	eng	I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
17716	eng	I am glad that you have returned safe.
17717	eng	What would you do if you were in my place?
17720	eng	I would like you to think about what you would have done in my place.
17721	eng	What would you do in my place?
17722	eng	That you don't believe me is a great pity.
17723	eng	The information you gave me is of little use.
17724	eng	You or I will be chosen.
17726	eng	Either you or I am wrong.
17727	eng	It is not necessary for you to take his advice if you don't want to.
17728	eng	If you're busy, I'll help you.
17729	eng	Didn't they teach you common sense as well as typing at the school where you studied?
17730	eng	I noticed you entering my room.
17732	eng	Never did I dream that you would lose.
17734	eng	I will lend you whatever book you need.
17735	eng	I need you.
17736	eng	You do not necessarily have to go there yourself.
17737	eng	You did well to keep the secret.
17738	eng	Whether you like her or not, you can't marry her.
17739	eng	I don't know whether you like her or not.
17740	eng	It is not good that you did not ask her name.
17741	eng	It is cruel of you to find fault with her.
17742	eng	What you said to her isn't accepted as a joke.
17743	eng	Either you or she has to go there.
17744	eng	As you have insulted him, he is cross with you.
17745	eng	We thought it wrong that you should punish him.
17746	eng	It is no use your waiting for him.
17747	eng	It is no use your trying to persuade him.
17748	eng	Does he know that you love him?
17749	eng	Imagine yourself to be in his place.
17750	eng	You did well not to follow his advice.
17751	eng	It was foolish of you to accept his offer.
17752	eng	You did wrong to refuse his help.
17753	eng	Either you or he is wrong.
17754	eng	Either you or he has to attend the meeting.
17755	eng	It was wise of you to ask him for help.
17756	eng	You are quite justified in answering him back.
17757	eng	Whatever you said to him made him feel better.
17758	eng	I can't approve of your going out with him.
17759	eng	I cannot approve of your going out with him.
17760	eng	I don't approve of your going out with him.
17761	eng	Either you are right or he is.
17764	eng	Show me what you bought.
17765	eng	How much is the car you are planning to buy?
17766	eng	I saw you with a tall boy.
17767	eng	He is no more foolish than you are.
17768	eng	It is amazing that you won the prize.
17769	eng	It is amazing; you should have won the prize.
17770	eng	It's a pity that you should leave Japan.
17772	eng	I'll take over your duties while you are away from Japan.
17773	eng	I am going to do it whether you agree or not.
17774	eng	I don't object to your going out to work, but who will look after the children?
17775	eng	I'm very happy you'll be visiting Tokyo next month.
17776	eng	You have good reason to be angry.
17777	eng	The success resulted from your efforts.
17778	eng	We were just talking about you when you called.
17780	eng	It is difficult for you to climb to the mountaintop.
17781	eng	It's quite plain that you haven't been paying attention.
17782	eng	Your advice led me to success.
17783	eng	It is a pity that you can't join us.
17784	eng	You had better not wake me up when you come in.
17785	eng	I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness.
17786	eng	Unless you make a decision quickly, the opportunity will be lost.
17787	eng	I hope that you will get well soon.
17789	eng	I found the very thing you had been looking for.
17790	eng	It is plain that you have done this before.
17791	eng	I don't care whichever you choose.
17792	eng	It is not surprising that you should be scolded by your teacher.
17793	eng	You speak first; I will speak after.
17794	eng	Well do I remember the day you were born.
17795	eng	I guess you are right.
17796	eng	If you are honest, I will hire you.
17797	eng	Do what you think is right.
17798	eng	Your success depends on your efforts.
17799	eng	Whether you will succeed or not depends on your efforts.
17800	eng	I'm so glad that you succeeded.
17801	eng	I am glad that you have succeeded.
17802	eng	I'm glad to hear of your success.
17803	eng	Tell me when you will call me.
17805	eng	It's to your credit that you told the truth.
17806	eng	What happened to the girl you were sharing the bedroom with?
17807	eng	I should be glad if you got the job.
17808	eng	You may or may not win.
17809	eng	I will do it on the condition that you help me.
17810	eng	If it were not for your help, I might have failed.
17811	eng	Thanks to your help, I could understand the book quite well.
17812	eng	Your o's look like a's.
17813	eng	They will have arrived there before you start.
17814	eng	He came after you left.
17815	eng	You must do your homework at once.
17816	eng	Who took care of the dog while you were away?
17817	eng	I will wait till you have written the letter.
17818	eng	It is strange that you should fail.
17819	eng	You may fail, for all I care.
17820	eng	The reason why you failed is you did not try hard enough.
17821	eng	When you speak of a pay-raise before recognition, I am inclined to think you are putting the cart before the horse.
17822	eng	A time will come when you will regret your action.
17823	eng	You may as well go yourself.
17824	eng	You should talk to the teacher yourself.
17825	eng	You talk next and you be quiet.
17826	eng	We heard the news that you had passed the exam.
17827	eng	I think it's a pity you could not come to our party.
17828	eng	I don't like you any more than you like me.
17829	eng	I love you more than you love me.
17831	eng	Either you or I must go in his place.
17834	eng	What's the reason that made you call me?
17835	eng	What is it that you want me to do?
17836	eng	I can't thank you enough for what you did for me.
17837	eng	I hope you will join us in the parade and march along the street.
17838	eng	I wish you could come with us.
17839	eng	I'll look after your affairs when you are dead.
17840	eng	I don't have as much money as you think.
17841	eng	How much money did you spend in total?
17842	eng	Can you account for all the money you spent?
17844	eng	I will wait until you have finished your homework.
17845	eng	It makes no difference whether you agree or not.
17846	eng	With your approval, I would like to offer him the job.
17847	eng	It was wise of you to take your umbrella with you.
17848	eng	Show me the doll that you bought yesterday.
17849	eng	Nothing is so tasty as the dish you make.
17850	eng	I'll help you so long as you do your best.
17851	eng	Choose the color you like the best.
17852	eng	The paint on the seat on which you are sitting is still wet.
17853	eng	It makes little difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
17854	eng	It will not make much difference whether you go today or tomorrow.
17855	eng	Your mother has made you what you are.
17856	eng	What you've just told me chimes in with what I heard yesterday.
17857	eng	What you need the most now is courage.
17858	eng	This is all you have to do now.
17859	eng	It is necessary for you to go and encourage the girl.
17860	eng	It makes no difference whether you go or not.
17863	eng	You don't need to go unless you want to.
17864	eng	If you don't go, I won't, either.
17865	eng	You don't have to go unless you want to.
17867	eng	I don't care as long as you are happy.
17868	eng	Your meaning is beyond me.
17869	eng	What you have said applies only to single women.
17871	eng	What you said surprised me.
17872	eng	Whatever you may say, I won't give it up.
17874	eng	The picture you are looking at is a copy of a Picasso.
17875	eng	The picture you are looking at costs 100,000 yen.
17876	eng	What I can't make out is why you have changed your mind.
17877	eng	I'll make allowances for your lack of experience.
17878	eng	By the time you get out of jail, she'll probably have gotten married.
17879	eng	Either you or your brother is wrong.
17881	eng	I know you are rich.
17882	eng	You can't be hungry. You've just had dinner.
17884	eng	I hope you'll never turn Communist.
17885	eng	What a lonely world it will be with you away!
17886	eng	Be sure to put out the fire before you leave.
17887	eng	I will not allow you to be ill-treated.
17888	eng	He will be studying when you get up.
17889	eng	She'll have left before you come back.
17890	eng	I wish you could drop in at my house on your way home.
17891	eng	I'll stay here till you get back.
17892	eng	I will have finished the work before you return.
17893	eng	The money you give them will be put to good use.
17894	eng	Thanks to your stupidity, we lost the game.
17895	eng	It's clear that you're wrong.
17897	eng	I do not for a moment think you are wrong.
17898	eng	I can't help but think you're making a mistake.
17900	eng	If you are wrong, I am wrong too.
17901	eng	You shouldn't have paid the bill.
17902	eng	It is important for you to learn a foreign language.
17903	eng	I'll open the curtain for you to look out.
17904	eng	I'm counting on you to join us.
17905	eng	I am counting on you to join us.
17906	eng	It is a pity that you cannot travel with us.
17907	eng	Hearing you sing, people might take you for a girl.
17909	eng	I'll come again when you are free.
17910	eng	It's no use your saying anything.
17911	eng	Whatever you may say, you won't be believed.
17912	eng	Say what you will, he won't accept your invitation.
17913	eng	I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
17914	eng	It matters little what you do.
17915	eng	I do not mind what you do.
17916	eng	Whatever you say, I'll marry her.
17917	eng	Say what you will, I will act on my own judgement.
17918	eng	No matter what you say, he still won't do it.
17919	eng	Whatever you may say, I don't believe you.
17921	eng	It's good to talk things over before you buy something.
17922	eng	I wish you were close to me.
17923	eng	It was bad of you to get angry at your wife.
17924	eng	Your refusal to help complicated matters.
17925	eng	I can no more speak French than you can speak English.
17926	eng	What is the main purpose of your studying English?
17927	eng	If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
17928	eng	It's evident that you told a lie.
17929	eng	What is that thing in your right hand?
17930	eng	Would you mind making an extra cup of coffee whenever you decide to have some?
17931	eng	It seems as if you are the first one here.
17932	eng	It is risky for you to go into that area alone.
17934	eng	I enjoyed the holiday all the better for being with you.
17935	eng	As long as you stick to one style, you can't hit upon a wonderful idea.
17936	eng	You are to blame.
17937	eng	You are not to blame, nor is he.
17938	eng	It is plain that you are to blame.
17939	eng	You need not take the trouble to go there.
17940	eng	You're going to leave for London next Sunday, aren't you?
17941	eng	It is because you are lazy that you cannot write your report.
17942	eng	I will come on Monday unless you write to the contrary.
17943	eng	I was about to leave when you telephoned.
17944	eng	I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
17945	eng	You go first.
17946	eng	I heard it from you.
17947	eng	I stayed home last night to be able to receive your call.
17948	eng	I didn't expect such a nice present from you.
17949	eng	You can do whatever you want to.
17950	eng	It was silly of you to trust them.
17951	eng	I would do it in a different way than you did.
17952	eng	What you've done is profitable only to the enemy.
17953	eng	In terms of the pay you will get, is this a good job?
17955	eng	If you were to fall from that bridge, it would be almost impossible to rescue you.
17956	eng	If you ask him again, he may change his mind.
17959	eng	No harm will come to you.
17960	eng	I think it's wonderful that you're going on a picnic.
17961	eng	Is it true that you are going to Paris?
17962	eng	I am not any more foolish than you are.
17963	eng	The shoes you are wearing look rather expensive.
17964	eng	I will see to it that you meet her at the party.
17965	eng	Say what you will, I think he is an honest person.
17966	eng	I will help him no matter what you say.
17968	eng	Say what you will; I won't change my mind.
17969	eng	I marvel how you could agree to the proposal.
17970	eng	It is obvious why you have a stomach-ache.
17971	eng	I can imagine how you felt.
17972	eng	However fast you may walk, you can't catch up with him.
17973	eng	Try as you may, you will not be able to read as many as five novels in a day.
17974	eng	Try to estimate how much you spent on books.
17975	eng	I have a good mind to strike you for being so rude.
17976	eng	No matter where you may go, don't forget to write to me.
17977	eng	I must go there irrespective of what you think.
17978	eng	You should have nothing to complain about.
17979	eng	No wonder you could not open the door.
17981	eng	What is it that makes you think that way?
17982	eng	I'm surprised at your behavior.
17983	eng	It's strange you say that.
17984	eng	I will do my best to put such an idea out of your head.
17985	eng	How can I feel relaxed, with you watching me like that?
17986	eng	I can't abide hearing you cry so bitterly.
17987	eng	It is outrageous that you should spend so much money.
17988	eng	It is a pity that you should lose such a chance.
17989	eng	It is foolish of you to believe such a thing.
17990	eng	It's absurd of you to do that.
17991	eng	It is absurd of you to do that.
17992	eng	It is no use your trying to deny it.
17993	eng	It is a great pity that you don't know it.
17994	eng	It makes no difference to me whether you believe it or not.
17995	eng	It makes little difference to me whether you believe it or not.
17996	eng	It is right that you should write it.
17997	eng	The day will come when you will realize it.
17998	eng	The time will come when you'll regret it.
17999	eng	I'm glad you liked it.
18000	eng	You are mad to try to do it all alone.
18001	eng	I wish you had not told the story to my mother.
18002	eng	When was it that you visited the museum?
18003	eng	It is no wonder that you are turning down the proposal.
18004	eng	What made it difficult for you to carry out the plan?
18005	eng	It is absolutely necessary that you be at the meeting.
18006	eng	You have no good reason for thinking as you do.
18007	eng	I cannot believe you did not see him then.
18008	eng	Ten to one you can pass the test.
18009	eng	The time will come when you will be sorry for it.
18010	eng	I'll do it, if you insist.
18011	eng	I can't work with you standing there.
18012	eng	By the time you got there, the sun had set.
18013	eng	You gave me a real surprise when you showed up there.
18014	eng	Since you say so.
18015	eng	You may well say so, but I cannot agree.
18016	eng	There is no reason why you shouldn't do such a thing.
18017	eng	I don't blame you.
18018	eng	I can't allow you to do that.
18019	eng	There are a good many reasons why you shouldn't do it.
18020	eng	I don't blame you for doing that.
18021	eng	We will pay you according to the amount of work you do.
18022	eng	I'm glad you enjoy skiing, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea.
18023	eng	I'll do everything you tell me to do.
18024	eng	Your conduct is absolutely shameful.
18025	eng	I cannot see you behaving like that.
18026	eng	I didn't expect you to get here so soon.
18027	eng	It was too bad you couldn't come.
18028	eng	It's a pity that you couldn't come.
18029	eng	It is easy for you to solve this problem.
18030	eng	You wrote this book?
18031	eng	I didn't know that you were in this town.
18032	eng	It is dangerous for you to swim in this river.
18033	eng	It is out of the question for you to go to New York this weekend.
18034	eng	It is very difficult for you to do this work.
18035	eng	The time will come when you will understand this.
18036	eng	Where was it that you found this key?
18037	eng	I didn't expect you to turn up here.
18038	eng	There is no need for you to stay here.
18039	eng	As long as you're here, I'll stay.
18040	eng	With you here beside me I'm not afraid of anything. You're my fortress.
18042	eng	The watch you gave me doesn't keep time.
18043	eng	I had no notion that you were coming.
18047	eng	My life would be completely empty without you.
18048	eng	You'll be missed by your friends.
18050	eng	We shall all miss you when you go away.
18051	eng	I miss you badly.
18052	eng	How I miss you.
18053	eng	I miss you very much.
18054	eng	We all miss you very much.
18055	eng	We will miss you badly.
18056	eng	Whenever you come, I'm ready.
18057	eng	It is because you work too much that you are sleepy all the time.
18058	eng	Why is it that you are always late?
18059	eng	You may stay here as long as you like.
18060	eng	You can talk until you're blue in the face, but you'll never convince me.
18061	eng	Laugh as much as you like; I'll stick to my plan to the bitter end.
18062	eng	I cannot endure your going.
18063	eng	You walk too fast for me to keep up with you.
18064	eng	If only you had told me the whole story at that time!
18065	eng	It is impossible for you to jump two meters high.
18066	eng	We think it is very dangerous that you're climbing the mountain alone.
18067	eng	Here is a letter for you.
18068	eng	Are you saying that our plan was accepted? I hope you're not showing me any premature happiness here.
18069	eng	You, be quiet!
18070	eng	Have you ever seen Mt. Fuji? It is beautiful beyond description.
18071	eng	You've filled out.
18072	eng	What time will you leave?
18073	eng	You don't understand.

18082	eng	How long does a bear sleep?
18083	eng	The bear began tearing at the tent.
18084	eng	When bears sleep or lie down, their postures depend on whether they want to get rid of heat or conserve it.
18085	eng	No one noticed the bear's appearance.
18086	eng	Take off your socks, please.

18154	eng	I felt hungry.
18155	eng	With hunger and fatigue, the dog died at last.
18156	eng	Hunger is one of the greatest social miseries.
18157	eng	Hunger is the best sauce.
18159	eng	He cannot be hungry; he has just had lunch.
18160	eng	Hunger compelled the boy to steal money from the cash register.
18161	eng	Hunger drove him to steal.
18162	eng	It is a shameful fact that, while there are lands where people suffer from hunger, within Japan there are many households and restaurants where much food is thrown away.

20371	eng	If you're not careful you'll miss a traffic sign!
20372	eng	I was very careful, but I caught a cold.
20373	eng	Watch out! There's a big hole there.
20374	eng	Beware! There's a car coming!
20375	eng	Take care of yourself, and have a good time!
20376	eng	After an awkward pause, Bill took her by the hand and dragged her upstairs.
20377	eng	The weather is fickle.
20378	eng	He is a good fellow, to be sure, but he isn't reliable.
20379	eng	Are you crazy?
20380	eng	I wish I could think of something to say.
20381	eng	The pitiful sight moved us to tears.
20383	eng	Faint heart never won fair lady.
20384	eng	It's just your imagination.
20385	eng	Whether you like it or not, you have to go.
20386	eng	Like it?
20388	eng	I hope you'll like it.
20389	eng	You like it, huh?
20390	eng	Please think nothing of it.
20391	eng	Don't worry about it!
20392	eng	Never mind.
20393	eng	Never mind. Anyone can make mistakes.
20394	eng	Never mind!
20395	eng	Caring means being alive.
20396	eng	I just brush it off.
20397	eng	It's all right.
20398	eng	Forget it.
20400	eng	I appreciate your concern.
20401	eng	It's not easy to part with one's favorite possessions.
20402	eng	You've got a good head on your shoulders.
20403	eng	I found myself lying in my bedroom.
20404	eng	Please drink the beer before it goes flat.
20405	eng	I'm exhausted.
20406	eng	Turn off the television. I can't concentrate.
20408	eng	You should continue until you're satisfied.
20409	eng	I'm out of my mind.
20410	eng	I'm not in the mood.
20411	eng	Now that I notice it, I have nowhere to run.
20412	eng	It was there, when I noticed it.
20413	eng	I found myself back in my room.
20414	eng	Thank goodness, you've come to.
20415	eng	It took him a moment to realize where he was after he came to.
20416	eng	He was so sad that he almost went mad.
20417	eng	I met nobody on my way home.
20418	eng	Could you show me your return ticket?
20419	eng	In the car on the way home, he was making plans for the next day.

20424	eng	I was caught in shower on my way home.
20425	eng	On arriving home, I discovered the burglary.
20426	eng	You can go home if you like.
20427	eng	I may have to come home late, in which case I'll telephone you.
20428	eng	Returnees have trouble getting used to life in Japan.
20429	eng	I will inquire about the matter after I return home.
20430	eng	Why don't you look in on Mr Anderson on your way back?
20431	eng	Be sure to call home before you leave the office.
20432	eng	Please turn out the lights when you leave.
20433	eng	I'm very sorry I came home so late.
20434	eng	You are home late.
20435	eng	It is not my intention to return.
20436	eng	You're back late. What have you been up to?
20437	eng	Can you find your way home?
20438	eng	Don't fool around on your way home.
20439	eng	Don't play around too much after school.
20440	eng	I'm fixing the radio which I found on my way home.
20441	eng	I caught sight of a parade on my way home.
20442	eng	I was caught in a shower on my way home.
20443	eng	The trip back was very comfortable.
20444	eng	Do you have a return ticket to Japan?
20445	eng	Hopefully you can rest and relax on the flight home.
20446	eng	Would you mind picking up something on the way back?
20447	eng	Please drop in at my house on your way home.
20448	eng	Please drop in on your way home.
20449	eng	It'd be great if you could pick up some bread before you come home.
20450	eng	I don't wanna go back.
20451	eng	I'll call by at the post office on the way home.
20452	eng	Wait here till I come back.
20453	eng	I will see him after I get back.
20454	eng	He asked me to wait there until he came back.
20455	eng	She scolded the child for coming home so late.
20456	eng	So nice that you are back.
20457	eng	On his return he found her daughter asleep.
20458	eng	My bicycle was gone when I returned.
20459	eng	Get back, get back!
20460	eng	How many pieces of carry-on are you going to take?
20461	eng	Are there movies on the plane?
20462	eng	Dinner will be served on board the plane.
20463	eng	His seat in the plane was on the aisle.
20464	eng	The riot police arrived on the scene.
20465	eng	Wit gives zest to conversation.
20466	eng	The captain will go to the meteorological office to get a weather briefing.
20468	eng	Passengers became nervous when the plane began to vibrate.
20469	eng	He is cranky.
20470	eng	The locomotive was pulling a long line of freight cars.
20471	eng	Mechanical power took the place of manual labor.
20472	eng	The downtime is caused by a mechanical problem.
20473	eng	The agonies of the machine age do not originate from the machines as such.
20474	eng	It is impossible to substitute machines for people themselves.
20475	eng	Press this button to start the machine.
20476	eng	I got the machine running.
20477	eng	The machine squealed for lack of oil.
20478	eng	Machinery uses a lot of electricity.
20480	eng	Machinery dispenses with much labor.
20481	eng	Machinery robs work of creative interest.
20482	eng	The machine was clogged with grease.
20483	eng	The machines are idle now.
20484	eng	You must feed the machine.
20485	eng	I can do it if you give me a chance.
20486	eng	I seize the moment and turn it to my advantage.
20487	eng	Don't throw away your chance.
20488	eng	You must take advantage of the opportunity.
20489	eng	One should always make the most of one's opportunities.
20490	eng	Thanks to the opportunity, we were able to avoid substantial effort.
20491	eng	I'll speak to him at the first opportunity.
20492	eng	A family should not spend all of its money to keep someone alive on a machine.
20493	eng	Chance is a nickname for Providence.
20494	eng	You should see this film if you get the opportunity.
20495	eng	You should change your job if the occasion arises.
20496	eng	I will see him at the first opportunity.
20497	eng	I will do it at the first opportunity.
20498	eng	It's a pity we didn't visit Tom when we had the chance.
20499	eng	The plane rose sharply before leveling off as it left the coast.
20500	eng	When the time is ripe, be bold and go for it! I'll stand by you.
20501	eng	There were two abstentions.
20502	eng	I was busy with work for the term exam.
20503	eng	The results of the term examination were anything but satisfactory.
20504	eng	I have to give myself up to studying for final exams.
20505	eng	I've really got to buckle down and study for our final exams.
20506	eng	I'm busy because the finals are drawing on.

20513	eng	As was expected, he succeeded in winning the prize.
20516	eng	I'm sure you'll whip us up something really good.
20517	eng	The restaurant was a bummer.
20518	eng	As was expected, he won the prize.
20519	eng	You must get the job done before the deadline.
20520	eng	Let's get an open ticket.
20521	eng	How long do you want it for?
20522	eng	The known must be separated from the unknown.
20523	eng	She knew what it was like for married women to look after houses, husbands and children.
20524	eng	Let bygones be bygones.
20525	eng	We tend to welcome only proofs of what we already know.
20526	eng	Now, the situation is out of hand.
20527	eng	I have already done my homework.
20528	eng	As you already know.
20529	eng	The odds are against me, so I think I'll quit now.
20530	eng	The flag is up.
20531	eng	Keep sight of the flag.
20532	eng	When I tried to move the desk, one of its legs made a jarring sound as it scraped across the floor.

20604	eng	You must not give up hope.
20605	eng	Having realized his hope, he returned home.
20606	eng	Don't give up hope.
20607	eng	Thoughts of hope, dreams I'll never find.
20608	eng	Hope is the last thing that man has to flee unto.
20609	eng	I didn't give up for lack of hope.
20610	eng	As long as you have hope, a chance remains.
20611	eng	The importation of rare wild animals to this country is strictly prohibited.
20612	eng	No one can turn the clock back.

20616	eng	To my joy, my daughter passed the examination.
20617	eng	To her joy, she passed the entrance examination.
20618	eng	I know you're happy about it. Why don't you just show it?
20619	eng	Strange to say, the figure went out of sight suddenly.
20620	eng	It may sound strange, but what she said is true.
20621	eng	Strange as it may sound, this is true.
20622	eng	It may sound strange, but what he said is true.

20680	eng	Joy was mingled with sorrow.
20681	eng	Short pleasure, long repentance.
20682	eng	Tears of joy rained down their cheeks.
20683	eng	Delight is the opposite of sorrow.
20684	eng	Waves of joy drift through my opened heart.
20685	eng	It is easier to sympathize with sorrow than to sympathize with joy.
20686	eng	Her face was animated by joy.
20687	eng	I jumped for joy.
20688	eng	His joy showed on his face.
20691	eng	Sensing danger, he ran away.
20692	eng	He stayed behind in view of possible danger.
20693	eng	Let's take a chance and go for broke.
20694	eng	Danger comes soonest when it is despised.
20695	eng	He was brave in the face of danger.
20696	eng	He was still as still in the presence of danger.

20699	eng	The red lamp lights up in case of danger.
20700	eng	There's a scent of danger.
20701	eng	Dangerous driving should be punished.
20702	eng	Is there any danger?
20703	eng	He remains calm in the face of danger.
20704	eng	No idea of danger crossed my mind then.
20705	eng	The more danger, the more honor.
20706	eng	This doesn't mean the danger has passed.
20707	eng	The danger past and God forgotten.
20708	eng	Dangers give relish to an adventure.
20709	eng	Danger. Keep out!
20710	eng	In a crisis you must keep your head.
20711	eng	It is essential to keep calm in a time of crisis and avoid going haywire.
20712	eng	I almost missed the train.
20713	eng	I was nearly run over by a car.

20724	eng	I had a narrow escape.
20725	eng	It was a close call when the little girl almost drowned in the lake.
20726	eng	Corporate bankruptcies continued at a high level last month.

20751	eng	Billy often hits his face against windows.
20753	eng	You look green.
20754	eng	Wash your face.
20755	eng	He told me to wash my face.
20756	eng	Wipe your face clean.

20758	eng	A shave, please.
20759	eng	Turn your face this way.
20760	eng	Looks aside, she is very good-natured.
20762	eng	Slapped on the face, I didn't fight back.
20763	eng	Wash up.

20785	eng	The rock rolled down the hillside.
20786	eng	Sitting on the rock, she sang a sweet song as she combed her hair.

24771	eng	Thank you all the same.
24772	eng	For some reason or other she shook her head.
24773	eng	Reflect on your own motives when making a decision.
24774	eng	Because of some technical problem, a movie was shown in place of the announced program.
24775	eng	What is most important is your strong will to master English.
24777	eng	The most important thing is thinking for oneself.

24798	eng	First of all, he is very worried about his daughter's health.
24799	eng	Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
24800	eng	Not having heard from him, I wrote to him again.
24801	eng	That won't change anything.
24803	eng	You have nothing to fear.
24804	eng	You have no need to be ashamed.
24805	eng	It is no use your pretending that you know nothing.

24807	eng	There is nothing to worry about.
24808	eng	Nothing can force me to give it up.
24809	eng	There is no hurry.
24810	eng	I could not see anything.
24811	eng	I have no real intent.
24812	eng	Nothing's gonna change my world.
24813	eng	Those who possess nothing lose nothing.
24814	eng	Above all, I want to be healthy.
24815	eng	Nothing is to be compared to its beauty.
24816	eng	I don't feel like anything.
24817	eng	Having nothing to do, he went downtown.
24818	eng	Having nothing to do, I watched television.
24819	eng	There's nothing to do, so I may as well go to bed.
24820	eng	Work is preferable to idleness.
24821	eng	Don't cry before you're hurt.
24822	eng	You can wear my scarf as long as you don't spill anything on it.
24823	eng	Everything points to his guilt.
24824	eng	Those who forget everything are happy.
24825	eng	You had better tell me the whole story.
24826	eng	He looked as if he knew all about it.
24827	eng	Sometimes everything goes wrong.
24828	eng	Everything seemed to go wrong with me.
24829	eng	Everything is now ready for you.
24830	eng	You didn't leave me shit.
24831	eng	Everything went better than I had expected.
24833	eng	No one shall be held in slavery.
24834	eng	Before everything you should take better care of your health.
24835	eng	What were we talking about?
24838	eng	What does this stand for?
24840	eng	It is good for nothing.
24842	eng	For what purpose did he come here?
24843	eng	Few people are free of care.
24844	eng	What do I have?
24846	eng	What thought do you think had the biggest impact on the English in the Middle Ages?
24847	eng	By what authority do you order me to do this?
24848	eng	Who are you to tell me to get out?
24849	eng	What flower do you like best?
24851	eng	Never hesitate to tell the truth.

24854	eng	Why did her father go to Japan?
24855	eng	What on earth do you want six copies of the same book for?
24856	eng	What are you working for?
24857	eng	What did you buy this expensive dictionary for?
24858	eng	What do you learn English for?
24859	eng	What did you buy it for?
24862	eng	For what?
24863	eng	What kind of sandwich do you want?
24867	eng	What for?
24868	eng	The allusion was not lost on me.
24869	eng	What will you have to eat?
24870	eng	Just tell me what you'd like me to do.
24871	eng	I will be glad if I can serve you in any way.
24872	eng	In fact, I'll even call George at the office and tell him he ought to come home and help out.

24893	eng	How blue the sky is!
24894	eng	He exclaimed, "What a dirty face you have!"
24895	eng	I can't say for sure.
24896	eng	What an incredible amount of work he has done!
24897	eng	I can't say.
24898	eng	I have no words to express my gratitude.

24918	eng	I'll get my son to wash my car somehow or other.
24919	eng	I hope I can manage to make both ends meet.
24920	eng	Let's try to arrange something.
24921	eng	Could you make time for me?
24922	eng	Push the job and get it done this week.

24940	eng	I beg your pardon?
24941	eng	Not knowing what to say, she just smiled.
24942	eng	I was wrong all the same.

27546	eng	Work hard, or you'll have to take the same course again next year.
27547	eng	Study hard, and you'll succeed.
27548	eng	Work hard, and you will pass the examination.
27550	eng	Study hard, or you'll fail the exam.
27551	eng	Work hard, or you will fail the examination.
27552	eng	He said to me, 'Study hard, or you won't pass the test.'
27553	eng	If you don't study hard, you'll continue to get poor scores.
27554	eng	If he had not worked hard, he would have failed the examination.
27555	eng	Hard work enabled him to get good marks.
27556	eng	There's a fortune in the making for any hard worker.
27557	eng	Those who work hard will succeed.
27558	eng	You can make your dream come true by working hard.
27560	eng	Work hard, and you will succeed.
27561	eng	Work hard, and your salary will be raised by degrees.
27562	eng	You won't succeed unless you work hard.
27563	eng	Nothing is more pleasant than taking a rest after hard work.
27564	eng	He must be tired after such hard work.
27565	eng	He remained poor despite being a hard worker.
27567	eng	He worked hard.
27569	eng	After much effort, he ended up with a contract.
27570	eng	I ran and ran, but missed the train.
27573	eng	I ran as fast as I could.
27574	eng	I know you worked very hard on it, but still I'm not satisfied with your report.
27575	eng	With great effort she managed to fold one more.
27576	eng	What are you doing so hard?
27577	eng	If he tries hard, he will succeed.
27578	eng	You can't get ahead if you don't work hard.
27579	eng	If he tried hard, he would succeed.
27582	eng	You cannot make a good mark without working hard.
27583	eng	I decided that I was going to work as hard as I can.
27584	eng	I mean to fight hard.
27585	eng	Hard work and dedication will bring you success.
27586	eng	It is good to keep studying all your life.
27587	eng	I'm trying hard, but can't think of her name.
27588	eng	Youth comes but once in life.
27589	eng	This is the most embarrassing moment of my life.
27590	eng	That might be the most painful experience in my life.
27591	eng	You'll be able to speak English better if you practice hard.
27592	eng	If you try very hard, you will succeed.
27593	eng	I'd been cheated out of my life savings!
27594	eng	I think it is my business to study hard.
27595	eng	I'll get even with you, if it takes me the rest of my life.
27596	eng	Only after a century and a half of confusion was the royal authority restored.
27597	eng	Who can read the future?
27598	eng	The worm turns.
27599	eng	A gust of wind swelled the sails.
27600	eng	Nothing is so pleasant as traveling alone.
27601	eng	My parents objected to my traveling alone, saying it would be dangerous.
27602	eng	I began living by myself.
27603	eng	Living on my own, I really miss my mom's cooking.
27604	eng	It was a great tragedy for them to lose their only son.
27605	eng	Left alone, the baby began to cry.
27606	eng	One murder makes a villain, millions a hero.
27607	eng	Each man stood up in turn and introduced himself.
27608	eng	If each would sweep before the door, we should have a clean city.
27609	eng	Choose the one.
27610	eng	All but one were present.
27611	eng	All except one agreed to his plan.
27612	eng	All the workers went home save one.
27613	eng	Left alone, the little girl began to cry.
27614	eng	One is a teacher, another is a doctor, and the other is a journalist.
27615	eng	One stayed and the other went away.
27616	eng	I dislike being alone.
27617	eng	The bus was empty except for one elderly woman.
27618	eng	An old man was at rest under the tree.
27619	eng	An old man broke into our conversation.
27620	eng	An old man came along.
27621	eng	One eyewitness is better than ten earwitnesses.
27622	eng	One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters.
27623	eng	A man overtook her.
27624	eng	A man drew near.
27625	eng	A man came up to me and asked for a match.
27626	eng	No student was able to answer the question.
27627	eng	A man appeared at the site.
27628	eng	A passenger fainted, but the stewardess brought him round.
27629	eng	A girl approached the king from among the crowd.
27630	eng	A boy is walking across the street.
27631	eng	I found that there was a little girl sobbing.
27632	eng	A woman appeared from behind a tree.
27633	eng	Within every man are thousands.
27634	eng	One of his colleagues whispered.
27635	eng	A student with a crew cut was sitting in the front seat.
27636	eng	The moment she was alone she opened the letter.
27637	eng	When left alone, he cried to his heart's content.
27638	eng	The little boy got into mischief when he was left alone.
27639	eng	Left alone, I sometimes feel like crying.
27640	eng	Left to itself, the baby cried itself to sleep.
27641	eng	Leave me alone.
27642	eng	Left alone, he began to read a book.
27643	eng	I like to travel by myself.
27644	eng	Nothing is so pleasant as travelling alone.
27645	eng	I got accustomed to living alone.
27646	eng	Can you put on a kimono by yourself?
27647	eng	Is it dangerous to take a subway alone?
27648	eng	One can't help many, but many can help one.
27649	eng	It is lonely to live alone.
27650	eng	Instead of going myself, I sent a messenger.
27651	eng	I'd rather stay home than go alone.
27652	eng	Let me go alone.
27653	eng	I don't want to go alone.
27654	eng	She allowed him to go alone.
27655	eng	It was careless of her to go out alone.
27656	eng	Though she wished to travel abroad by herself, she thought better of it.
27657	eng	You cannot lift the piano alone.
27658	eng	I think it's dangerous to climb that mountain alone.
27659	eng	Can you move this desk by yourself?
27660	eng	Did you come here alone?
27662	eng	One person more or less doesn't make much difference.
27663	eng	Each individual paid 1,000 dollars.
27665	eng	The admission is ten dollars a person.
27666	eng	For personal reasons.
27667	eng	It's good to be able to concentrate single-mindedly on your work, but you're completely ignoring the people around you.
27668	eng	It won't hurt you to skip one meal.
27669	eng	Take me with you.
27670	eng	Won't you come with me?
27672	eng	Come with me, will you?
27673	eng	I'm sorry for your not having come with us.
27675	eng	Would you play with me?
27676	eng	Won't you go shopping with me?
27677	eng	I'm looking forward to serving your company.
27678	eng	Working together, they cleaned the entire house in no time.
27679	eng	He was always pulling my leg when we worked together.
27680	eng	Come along with me and go fishing.
27681	eng	Do you mind if I join your trip to the country?
27682	eng	What do you say to going fishing with me?
27683	eng	May I run with you?
27684	eng	What do you say to dining out together?
27685	eng	Would you like to have lunch together?
27686	eng	How about eating out with me?
27687	eng	Can I take your picture with us?
27689	eng	Let us go together. We can swim across the river, carry off the bear cubs, take them to the house on the mountain, and together find happiness.
27690	eng	I wish I could go with you, but as it is, I can't.
27692	eng	I would like to go with you.
27693	eng	Do you want to come along?
27694	eng	Let's work together to do our best.
27696	eng	Put it on one bill, please.
27698	eng	Let's sing some English songs together.
27699	eng	Will you join us for a swim?
27700	eng	Would you like to go swimming with us?
27701	eng	Would you like to go see a movie with me?
27702	eng	Will you join me for a drink?
27703	eng	She told him once and for all that she would not go to the movie with him.
27704	eng	Why don't you come in for a cup of coffee and a chat?
27706	eng	When we are with a person we don't want to be seen with, we often meet someone we know.
27707	eng	Do you want to come along and give it a go?
27708	eng	I'm coming with you.
27709	eng	Shall I go together with you?
27710	eng	Hard work has brought him success.
27711	eng	With great effort he climbed up the tree.
27712	eng	A moment's hesitation may cost a pilot his life.
27713	eng	I must have stolen it when I lost control of myself momentarily.
27714	eng	There was a momentary pause.
27715	eng	For a moment, he thought of going after the man.
27716	eng	We have used our ration of coal for the week.
27717	eng	I was in the hospital for a week.
27718	eng	We plan to stay a week.
27719	eng	A week's reflection led to a new plan.
27720	eng	I will give you back the CD in a week.
27721	eng	I stayed home for a week.
27722	eng	It kept raining for a week.
27723	eng	Don't commit yourself to doing it within a week.
27724	eng	We are able to deliver within a week.
27725	eng	I'll finish the work in a week or less.
27726	eng	I went without food for a week.
27727	eng	There are seven days in a week.
27729	eng	I would like a week off with pay.
27730	eng	He took a week off.
27731	eng	How many days a week do you go to school?
27732	eng	How often a week do you take a bath?
27733	eng	We have five English classes a week.
27734	eng	You can read ten books in a week? Don't you mean in a month?
27735	eng	I will lend you some money, on condition that you will repay it in a week.
27736	eng	We had to learn the lines of the play in park.
27737	eng	I shall see him in less than a week.
27738	eng	The weather has been nice all week.
27739	eng	I'd been on my own all week and was starving for conversation.
27740	eng	I've been laid up with flu for the last week.
27742	eng	It's a temporary condition.
27743	eng	For a while, I was really into cola- drinking it every day.
27744	eng	I waited for an hour, but he didn't appear.
27745	eng	I've been waiting for one and a half-hours.
27746	eng	I met her an hour ago.
27747	eng	It stopped snowing an hour ago.
27748	eng	An hour's drive brought us to the airport.
27749	eng	I've been waiting for you for over an hour.
27750	eng	I'll be back within an hour.
27751	eng	Ten to one it'll clear up in an hour or so.
27752	eng	Scarcely an hour goes by that I don't I think of you with love.
27753	eng	Will you lend me your bicycle for an hour?
27754	eng	He should get to your house in an hour.
27755	eng	Do you think you can make out the list in an hour?
27756	eng	Please cover for me at the reception desk for about one hour.
27757	eng	He who steals a pin will steal an ox.
27758	eng	Nothing succeeds like success.
27759	eng	At one time we were enemies, but we've buried the hatchet and we are now on friendly terms with each other.
27760	eng	For a guy who was chosen by his father as the only son to be taught the secrets of this martial art, he doesn't have much of a kick.
27761	eng	I can't afford $40 for one book!
27762	eng	I arrived at Narita the day before yesterday.
27763	eng	It has been raining since the day before yesterday, but it may clear up this afternoon.
27764	eng	It has been raining on and off since the day before yesterday.
27765	eng	I received your letter the day before yesterday.
27766	eng	They left there the day before yesterday.
27767	eng	He may have absented himself from school the day before yesterday.
27768	eng	The day before yesterday we arrived at Osaka.
27769	eng	I met her by chance on the train the day before yesterday.
27770	eng	The economic strength of a country lies not alone in its ability to produce, but also in its capacity to consume.
27771	eng	It is important for a nation to have an adequate mix of monetary and fiscal policies.
27772	eng	The amount of paper produced by a country is closely related to its cultural standards.
27773	eng	We should lose no time in leaving here.
27774	eng	Not a moment could be lost.
27775	eng	There is no time to be lost.
27776	eng	The party returned safe and sound.
27777	eng	The party went to China by sea.
27778	eng	The party set out for Kobe.
27779	eng	The party reached the mountaintop yesterday.
27780	eng	The party arrived at Kyoto.
27781	eng	The party fought their way up.
27782	eng	The party went forward in the face of danger.
27783	eng	The party set out regardless of the bad weather.
27784	eng	The party started for New York.
27785	eng	The party flew nonstop from New York to Paris.
27786	eng	The party did not succeed in climbing the mountain.
27787	eng	The party stayed in Kyoto for a short period.
27788	eng	The party crossed over to America.
27789	eng	They are a party of six.
27790	eng	The party walked down the mountain.
27791	eng	The party started soon after his arrival.
27792	eng	The party, therefore, had to take another route.
27793	eng	The leader of the party is a famous scientist.
27794	eng	Write on every other line.
27795	eng	The seats were reserved for the party.
27796	eng	Can I have a bite?
27797	eng	Write on alternate lines.
27798	eng	Many were eager to get in on the act.
27799	eng	They all get lumped together as English texts. But in fact these books are extremely varied and wide-ranging.
27800	eng	I will bite just a little bit.
27801	eng	Greta chugged the beer in one gulp.
27802	eng	A bare word of criticism makes her nervous.
27803	eng	I'll give you a piece of advice.
27804	eng	Let me give you a piece of advice.
27805	eng	Let me say.
27807	eng	You have something to say about everything, don't you?
27808	eng	He didn't say a word.
27809	eng	In a word, she isn't any use.
27810	eng	In a word, he is a man of genius.
27811	eng	In a word, he is a coward.
27812	eng	In a word, you are in the wrong.
27813	eng	In a word, it's ridiculous.
27814	eng	In a word, I think he's a fool.
27815	eng	Off hand, I'd say her problem is shyness.
27816	eng	An apparently small event may lead to a great result.
27817	eng	I saw at a glance that the empty house was badly in need of repair.
27818	eng	I saw at a glance that there was something the matter with my father.
27819	eng	At first glance, the question seemed easy.
27820	eng	Nothing could be more reasonable, on the face of it.
27821	eng	January is the first month of the year.
27822	eng	At first sight, he seemed kind and gentle.
27823	eng	Women who, at first glance, appear to be completely ordinary also don't seem to be in that much of a rush to get married.
27824	eng	We have snow in January.
27825	eng	I'm taking an exam in January.
27826	eng	It is important to be accomplished in some art.
27827	eng	Will you listen to a piece of music?
27828	eng	Please sing a song.
27829	eng	I want to sing a song.
27830	eng	Let's take a rest.
27831	eng	How about taking a rest?
27832	eng	Take a rest, or you will be worn out.
27833	eng	She came alive after taking a rest.
27834	eng	I paid in a lump sum when I bought a television set.
27835	eng	Once you skip a lesson, it's hard to catch up with your classmates.
27837	eng	The family had a hard time after the war.
27838	eng	They moved to New York, but adapted easily to their new surroundings.
27839	eng	Except for Tom, the family was all watching TV in silence.
27840	eng	The family moved from their native Germany to Chicago around the year 1830.
27841	eng	He is the black sheep of the family.
27842	eng	The whole family is out for a walk.
27843	eng	I went to the South Pacific for a summer of romantic adventure.
27844	eng	Count as one fractions of half a yen and over, but ignore those of less.
27845	eng	The sky looks threatening.
27846	eng	A really perceptive person can figure out a whole situation with just a few clues. That's the kind of person I want you to become.
27847	eng	A word is enough to a wise man.
27848	eng	I don't like being made a fool of.
27849	eng	I'll tell you a story.
27850	eng	I'll give you a piece of good advice.
27851	eng	One important thing to remember is that Americans may remain silent when you say something they don't agree with.
27852	eng	May I ask a favor of you?
27853	eng	A single mistake, and you are a failure.
27854	eng	A miss is as good as a mile.
27855	eng	One is new, and the other is old.
27856	eng	This carpet is one of the most beautiful.
27858	eng	You should concentrate on one thing and learn to do it well.
27859	eng	An idea occurred to me.
27860	eng	To know a language is one thing, and to teach it is another.
27862	eng	For one thing, he thinks she is stupid, for another, he doesn't like her.
27863	eng	For one thing, I am poor; for another, I am busy.
27864	eng	For one thing, I'm penniless; for another, I don't have the time.
27865	eng	For one thing, I couldn't afford to do that.
27866	eng	For one thing, I've no money, and for another, I've no leisure.
27867	eng	This is true partly because non-Westerners have begun to take pride in their own cultures and partly because those areas of the world where forks are not used have some of the highest birth rates.
27869	eng	Would you do me a favor?
27872	eng	May I ask you to do me a favor?
27874	eng	I have a favor to ask of you.
27875	eng	Not a drop of rain fell for a month, so they had to dig a well.
27876	eng	You'll make a fortune by taking a chance.
27877	eng	The Isonos would often go hiking.
27878	eng	I feel exactly the same as Mr Isoda.
27879	eng	Child-care leave and time off to care for the aged are needed in order to respond to demographic changes now taking place in Japan.
27880	eng	A growing child requires more food.
27881	eng	Mr Iuchi has no one to fall back on.
27882	eng	Inoue doesn't like computers.
27883	eng	A well is a place where you can get water.
27884	eng	The well has run dry.
27885	eng	There was no water in the well.
27886	eng	There was little water in the well.
27887	eng	The well ran dry.
27888	eng	Please draw water from the well.
27889	eng	He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill.
27890	eng	Can I use my medical insurance?
27891	eng	I'd like to get medical insurance.
27892	eng	Do you have medical insurance?
27893	eng	The medical supplies were allocated to the victims of the disaster.
27894	eng	We can say that there's not a clear winner in terms of a policy to curtail medical expenses and benefits.
27895	eng	In medical research, one of the first problems is to isolate the cause of the disease.
27896	eng	The doctors thought he was dead, but today he is still alive and healthy, and has a job and a family.
27897	eng	Please call me a doctor.
27898	eng	Doctors have offered me nothing but sleeping pills.
27899	eng	Could you call a doctor, please?
27900	eng	Do you think we should send for the doctor?
27901	eng	Please call in a doctor.
27902	eng	Shall I go for the doctor?
27904	eng	You must send for the doctor.
27905	eng	Send for the doctor.
27906	eng	Will you send for a doctor?
27907	eng	The doctor was sent for.
27908	eng	You'd better send for a doctor.
27909	eng	He had been ill for a week when they sent for a doctor.
27910	eng	Doctors and hospitals should help the people who can get healthy again.
27911	eng	Doctors should help the sick or injured person.
27912	eng	The doctor analyzed the blood sample for anemia.
27913	eng	The doctor bent over the sick boy.
27914	eng	The doctor sat up all night with the sick old man.
27915	eng	Doctors do not always live long.
27916	eng	So the doctor started to examine her.
27917	eng	The surgeon operated on her for lung cancer.
27918	eng	The doctor advised her to enter the hospital.
27919	eng	The doctor told her that she should take a rest.
27920	eng	The doctor ordered her to go on a strict diet.
27921	eng	The doctor gave it to her.
27922	eng	The doctor persuaded him to give up smoking.
27923	eng	The doctor called him back.
27924	eng	The doctors tell you that he is brain-dead.
27925	eng	The doctor felt his pulse.
27926	eng	The doctor set his broken leg.
27927	eng	The doctor cured him of his illness.
27928	eng	The doctor cured him of his cancer.
27929	eng	The doctor released him from his pain.
27930	eng	The doctor gave him the medicine.
27931	eng	The physician prescribed his patient some medicine.
27932	eng	The doctor advised him to stop working too much.
27933	eng	His doctor told him to cut down on drinking.
27934	eng	The doctor advised him to abstain from drinking.
27935	eng	The doctor advised him to keep away from drinking.
27936	eng	The doctor told him to rest at home, which is advice he followed.
27937	eng	The doctor suggested that he give up smoking.
27938	eng	His doctor ordered him to rest.
27939	eng	The doctor ordered that he take a rest.
27940	eng	The doctor warned him of the dangers of smoking.
27941	eng	The doctor told him to give up smoking and drinking.
27942	eng	The doctor advised him not to eat between meals.
27943	eng	The doctor advised him to do more exercise.
27944	eng	The doctor told him to cut down on smoking.
27945	eng	The doctor advised him to give up smoking.
27946	eng	The doctor advised him not to smoke.
27947	eng	The doctor alerted him to the riskiness of the medicine.
27948	eng	The doctor said that he would be well if he took his medicine.
27949	eng	The doctor suggested that he should give up smoking.

28795	eng	We must make the best we can of the few natural resources we have.
28796	eng	We should do our best.
28797	eng	We've made a final decision.
28799	eng	We considered going, but finally decided against it.
28800	eng	We are liable to err.
28801	eng	We should so act that we shall have nothing to regret.
28802	eng	We discussed the matter with each other.
28803	eng	We must try to preserve the remains of ancient civilizations.
28804	eng	We have established the institute with a view to facilitating the research.
28805	eng	We must make the best of what we are.
28806	eng	We were obliged to give up our plan.
28807	eng	While we hate force, we recognize the need for law and order.
28808	eng	We must try to break the deadlock.
28809	eng	We were crowded into the small room.
28810	eng	We discussed the matter from an educational point of view.
28812	eng	It should be stressed that we are often influenced by advertising without being aware of it.
28813	eng	We were all drenched with perspiration.
28814	eng	We were all shaking from the bitter cold.
28815	eng	We all shuddered from the great shock.
28816	eng	We are all looking forward to seeing you and your family.
28817	eng	We wanted to speak to the president of the company, but he refused to speak to us.
28818	eng	We participated in the athletic meet of our company.
28819	eng	We look back on days gone by, if not always with affections, at any rate with a kind of wistfulness.
28820	eng	No one of us can cut himself off from the body of the community to which he belongs.
28821	eng	We are studying in order to pass the STEP 2nd grade test.
28822	eng	We die only once, and for such a long time.
28823	eng	We were as one in our opinion.
28824	eng	We were all ears.
28825	eng	We climbed higher so that we might get a better view.
28826	eng	We didn't mean to leave Mary out of the plan.
28827	eng	All of us are connected with the past and the future as well as the present.
28828	eng	We were all surprised at the effect the news had on him.
28830	eng	We were all very happy at breakfast.
28831	eng	We have yet to learn the truth.
28832	eng	We have yet to learn all the facts.
28833	eng	We should sometimes pause to think.
28834	eng	We should read as many books as possible.
28835	eng	We stood at the door and waited.
28836	eng	We must put an end to a bad habit as soon as possible.
28837	eng	It is not for us to live in such a fine house.
28838	eng	We must guard against mistakes in spelling.
28839	eng	We considered the problem from all angles.
28840	eng	We love the man all the better for his faults.
28841	eng	We must make up for the loss.
28842	eng	We measured the depth of the river.
28843	eng	We must study the affair as a whole.
28844	eng	We could get over the difficulty.
28845	eng	We've set the meeting tentatively for Monday. It's subject to change.
28846	eng	We looked forward to the party.
28847	eng	We must go without luxuries.
28848	eng	At best we can only hope for a small profit.
28849	eng	We elected Jane chairperson.
28850	eng	We must consider these matters as a whole.
28851	eng	We are very much concerned about the future of this country.
28852	eng	We were certain of winning the game.
28853	eng	We narrowly missed the accident.
28854	eng	We found out a secret door behind the curtain.
28855	eng	It should not be possible for us to enjoy them without giving something in return.
28857	eng	We differ from them in some respects.
28858	eng	We shall overcome all our difficulties.
28859	eng	We were wont to meet at that pleasant spot.
28860	eng	We look on her as a loose woman.
28861	eng	We couldn't find out her whereabouts.
28862	eng	We were surprised at the ease with which he solved the problem.
28863	eng	We cannot dispense with the rainforests.
28864	eng	We lay emphasis on the importance of being sincere.
28865	eng	We are indirectly dependent upon the labour of others for all the necessities and comforts of our lives.
28866	eng	We credit Peary with having discovered the North Pole.
28867	eng	We must defend our freedom at all cost.
28868	eng	We sat, as it were, on a volcano.
28869	eng	We find ourselves in the twilight of our civilization.
28870	eng	Our plane was flying over the Pacific Ocean.
28871	eng	Our plane was flying above the clouds.
28872	eng	Our feelings towards him are mixed.
28873	eng	Not a day passes in which we don't use electricity in our daily lives.
28874	eng	You stood out in our circle.
28875	eng	The records of our discussions are kept by the secretary.
28876	eng	Language as we know is a human invention.
28877	eng	Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
28878	eng	Our teacher is a gentleman in the true sense of the word.
28879	eng	Our policies and systems are getting outdated and need revising, but to try to swap horses while crossing a stream might be dangerous.
28880	eng	Our generation has seen a lot of changes.
28881	eng	Our world is only a small part of the universe.
28882	eng	The obstacles to our progress have been removed at last.
28883	eng	Our letters probably crossed in the mail.
28884	eng	In our society we find men of integrity along with crooks.
28885	eng	We've received a lot of applications in answer to our advertisements.
28886	eng	Our tastes in art agree.
28887	eng	Don't mention our plan to anybody.
28888	eng	Our plan will call for a lot of money.
28889	eng	Our project didn't get off the ground until he joined the company.
28890	eng	Most of our money goes for food.
28891	eng	Our plans for the vacation are still up in the air.
28892	eng	Our patience is in much the same condition as yesterday.
28893	eng	Our company pays badly.
28894	eng	It will be three months before our house is completed.
28895	eng	Although our universe is still young, theorists are busy exploring its ultimate fate.
28896	eng	Not all of us are born with musical talent.
28897	eng	There is nothing in the world but teaches us some good lesson.
28898	eng	We had scarcely returned when it began raining.
28899	eng	We cannot know too much about the language we speak every day of our lives.
28900	eng	Language, as we know it, is a human invention.
28901	eng	To our great relief, she returned home safe and sound.
28902	eng	If we suspect others, others will suspect us just as much.
28903	eng	Whatever you say, he won't change his mind.
28904	eng	No one knows the real reason why we love dogs.
28905	eng	It should not be possible for us to enjoy them.
28906	eng	Three hours is too short for us to discuss that matter.
28907	eng	It was just an accident that we met at the store.
28908	eng	A problem of whose importance we are fully aware.
28909	eng	No one ever knew the true story except the three of us.
28910	eng	Give me liberty or give me death.
28911	eng	He shivered a little in spite of himself.
28912	eng	I am ashamed of myself.
28913	eng	Broken glass lay scattered all over the road.
28914	eng	I've caught a bad cold.
28915	eng	Stop yelling, I beg you.
28916	eng	A man of straw is worth a woman of gold.
28917	eng	The crocodile, which produces only male young in hotter weather, might die out too because there will be no females to breed.
28919	eng	It seems that Wataru devoted himself to his studies.
28920	eng	I know better than to lend him money.
28921	eng	From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.
28922	eng	We all learned the poem by heart.
28923	eng	I have to get some new clothes.
28924	eng	I'm working in Tokyo now.
28925	eng	Please take me across the river.
28926	eng	Please take me over to the other side.
28927	eng	I'm going to Europe next week.
28928	eng	I'll be sixteen years old next month.
28929	eng	I study about two hours every day.
28930	eng	I must finish my homework before dinner.
28931	eng	I put away 10 dollars each month.
28932	eng	I walked up the hill.
28933	eng	I should like to have a friend to correspond with.
28934	eng	I usually go to bed at ten.
28935	eng	I prefer traveling by train to flying.
28936	eng	I'm tired now.
28937	eng	I tried to warn her, but she wouldn't listen.
28938	eng	I'm looking forward to hearing from her.
28939	eng	I have a firm belief in his innocence.
28940	eng	I regret not having taken his advice.
28941	eng	I do not love him the less for his faults.
28942	eng	I didn't want his help, but I had to accept it.
28943	eng	I could not convince him of his mistake.
28944	eng	I couldn't get in touch with him.
28945	eng	I saw him run away.
28946	eng	I have not yet learned whether he reached there or not.
28947	eng	I like both dogs and cats.
28948	eng	I know an American girl who speaks Japanese very well.
28949	eng	I am pleased with myself.
28950	eng	I don't think I'm cut out for city life.
28951	eng	I did some work after breakfast and went out.
28952	eng	I intend to take my position as a third party.
28953	eng	I am looking for a house to rent.
28954	eng	I can't walk because of my broken leg.
28955	eng	I have little knowledge of biochemistry.
28956	eng	I am completely against it.
28957	eng	I feel for you deeply.
28958	eng	I swim once a week.
28959	eng	I got my hands quite dirty.
28960	eng	I wrote off for an application form.
28962	eng	I like to perform magic tricks for kids, but they sometimes fall flat.
28963	eng	I couldn't recognize him at first.
28964	eng	I intended to visit Rome last year.
28965	eng	I am a lapsed vegetarian.
28966	eng	I want a wife and children, and so I need a house.
28967	eng	I had enough to do to catch the last bus.
28968	eng	I'll never be able to play again.
28969	eng	I may have nothing now, but I shall always have something to remember, while you have no memories at all.
28970	eng	I have nothing to boast about.
28971	eng	I have a cat and a dog.
28972	eng	I want to go with you.
28973	eng	We've finished cleaning our classroom.
28974	eng	I'm from Kyoto.
28975	eng	I was a first year student last year.
28976	eng	We decided to put off the meeting until next Sunday.
28977	eng	I was weary of doing the same thing over and over again.
28978	eng	I like music, and I listen to it every day.
28979	eng	I'd rather go swimming.
28980	eng	I must make up for lost time by driving fast.
28981	eng	I have a respect for those who went before me.
28982	eng	I was forced to accept her proposal.
28983	eng	I simply don't understand this.
28984	eng	I would be very pleased to go with you.
28985	eng	I have almost no money with me.
28987	eng	I am good friends with Beth.
28988	eng	I was able to play piano very well.
28989	eng	I like pizza very much.
28990	eng	I cannot go to the party, but thank you for inviting me all the same.
28991	eng	I am determined to make a living as a playwright at all costs.
28992	eng	How happy I am!
28993	eng	I would not leave you for all the world.
28994	eng	I managed to get there in time.
28995	eng	As far as I'm concerned, I will not approve of the plan.
28996	eng	I was appalled at the sight.
28997	eng	I'm learning how to type.
28998	eng	I doubt whether it is true or not.
28999	eng	I have nothing to say against it.
29000	eng	I didn't consider the subject seriously.
29001	eng	I have nothing to do with the affair.
29002	eng	I have hopes of doing well in that business.
29003	eng	I built a new house in view of the mountain.
29004	eng	The tune was not familiar to me.
29005	eng	I was given training in that school.
29006	eng	I didn't take part in the conversation.
29007	eng	I'm looking at the flower.
29008	eng	I really enjoyed myself at the party.
29009	eng	I was absent from the party.
29010	eng	I am quite unhappy about it.
29011	eng	I wanted to go there.
29012	eng	I didn't mean to do that.
29013	eng	I will write Judy a letter.
29014	eng	I'm staying at the Sheraton Hotel.
29015	eng	I went into details.
29016	eng	I've read any and every book in this library.
29017	eng	I must pull myself together to overcome this incident.
29018	eng	Each time I see this picture, I remember my father.
29019	eng	I paid 40,000 yen for this tape recorder.
29020	eng	I prefer coffee to tea.
29021	eng	I am not the Christ but I am sent ahead of him.
29022	eng	When I see you, you always remind me of my brother.
29023	eng	I invited them to the party.
29024	eng	His name has completely gone out of my mind.
29025	eng	I don't like his shallow personality.
29026	eng	What he said really hurt me.
29027	eng	I couldn't help but turn down his offer.
29028	eng	I am a student at Oxford University.
29029	eng	He got very angry, for she refused to follow his advice.
29030	eng	I succeeded in worming out the secret.
29031	eng	He has been to India.
29032	eng	I always walk to school.
29033	eng	I went to bed later than usual.
29034	eng	I wasn't always happy.
29035	eng	I am always helped by you.
29036	eng	I have a desire to go to England.
29037	eng	I captured butterflies with a net.
29038	eng	I haven't a very good dictionary.
29039	eng	I can beat you to the station.
29040	eng	I can understand your language.
29041	eng	I am much concerned about your health.
29042	eng	I want to travel with you.
29043	eng	I took it that you would come.
29044	eng	That's the part I liked best.
29045	eng	I'd like to reserve a table for three.
29046	eng	I saw a movie for the first time in two years.
29047	eng	I exempted her from working overtime.
29048	eng	I am a bachelor.
29049	eng	I am at home.
29050	eng	I met Mary and John when in London.
29051	eng	I lost the camera I had bought the day before.
29052	eng	I availed myself of this favorable opportunity.
29053	eng	I believe in Ken.
29055	eng	I don't want to identify myself with that group.
29056	eng	I am more beautiful than you.
29057	eng	It seems to me that you are wrong.
29058	eng	And I will raise it again in three days.
29059	eng	He has said so himself to my knowledge.
29060	eng	You are welcome to any book in my library.
29061	eng	My uncle has a store along the street.
29062	eng	My watch keeps very good time.
29063	eng	All hope of my promotion went up in smoke after my reorganization plan fell through.
29064	eng	Do you think that my way of teaching is wrong?
29065	eng	Please don't take my mind off the work.
29066	eng	The men I meet are all very nice.
29067	eng	My house stands on a hill.
29068	eng	My house is only a mile from here.
29069	eng	Pass me the wine, please.
29070	eng	My aunt lives in New York.
29071	eng	I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist.
29072	eng	Work is all in all to me.
29073	eng	I have no time to watch TV.
29074	eng	I have no particular reason to do so.
29075	eng	I have a lot of work to do.
29076	eng	Let us students contribute to the welfare of the victims of the earthquake; even loose change will go a long way.
29077	eng	We walked among the trees.
29078	eng	We should love our neighbors.
29079	eng	We will have a math class tomorrow.
29080	eng	We can normally conceal our thoughts from others.
29081	eng	We crossed several rivers on the way.
29082	eng	We have seen three wars.
29083	eng	When we go to bed, we say "good night".
29084	eng	We covered some 100 miles in the car.
29085	eng	We are in the tie-up.
29086	eng	We discussed the plan yesterday.
29087	eng	We shouted in order to warn everyone of the danger.
29088	eng	We all took it for granted that the professor could speak English.
29089	eng	We have known each other for many years now.
29090	eng	We all try hard to make the grade in life, but only a few succeed.
29091	eng	We all make fools of ourselves at times.
29092	eng	We got the tree up.
29093	eng	We managed to get it back without her knowing about it.
29094	eng	We noticed the man enter her room.
29095	eng	We took a taxi so as to reach there on time.
29096	eng	We elected Jeffrey captain of our team.
29097	eng	After we had walked for some time, we came to the lake.
29098	eng	We were impatient for the concert to begin.
29099	eng	We drove to Hakone last Sunday.
29100	eng	We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
29101	eng	We all knew that Bob was on a wild-goose chase after Marge, because she was already happily engaged.
29102	eng	We've been horsing around too much; it's high time we got down to brass tacks.
29103	eng	We are anxious for your help.
29104	eng	Our school is across the river.
29105	eng	Our efforts will soon bear fruit.
29106	eng	Our firm is a giant one, and there are some rules and regulations, which should be revised or rescinded to reduce red tape and increase efficiency.
29107	eng	It isn't necessary to make a decision now about where we'll meet.
29108	eng	We were delayed by traffic congestion, so we had to hurry.
29109	eng	I cannot agree with you on this point.
29110	eng	I'll get some glasses.
29111	eng	The party was well along when I came.
29112	eng	I was taking a bath when the telephone rang.
29113	eng	Whenever I needed money as a college student, my parents always came through.
29114	eng	It is just a year since I got married.
29115	eng	When I came home, he was watching TV.
29116	eng	You can't wring any more money from me.
29117	eng	It was during my college years that I took up tennis.
29118	eng	I got control of the works.
29119	eng	It is the car that we have wanted.
29120	eng	When I see this picture, I always think of the old days.
29121	eng	Now that I am here, you don't have to worry.
29122	eng	Don't enter the room until I say "All right."
29123	eng	We rented that house, not because we were pleased with it, but because it was near the station.
29124	eng	A few words may betray a man's true character.
29125	eng	It's hard for him to live on his small pension.
29126	eng	You can use the delivery service for a small additional charge.
29127	eng	It's hard for me to live on my small income.
29128	eng	The slightest mistake may lead to a fatal disaster.
29129	eng	Don't haggle over a small sum of money.
29130	eng	What little guidance I had I owe to a young man.
29131	eng	What little money he earned he spent on books.
29132	eng	She has a little money put aside.
29133	eng	It would be unwise, not to say stupid, of you to quit your first job after only six months.
29134	eng	Only 40 percent of students go on to university.
29135	eng	After only 36 months, Koko could use 184 signs.

29138	eng	Cherry trees are now in bloom in Washington.
29139	eng	The eagle is king of birds.
29140	eng	The eagle dived at its prey.
29142	eng	An eagle is flying in the sky.
29143	eng	Don't bother to call on him.
29144	eng	Please don't go to the trouble of coming to our office.
29145	eng	Don't bother to call me.
29146	eng	I may be playing the devil's advocate, but I have to ask, what are we going to do if we don't get all the customers we expect?
29147	eng	It is kind of you go out of your way to help me.
29148	eng	You don't have to go to the trouble of getting an umbrella.
29149	eng	Thank you very much for coming all the way to see me off.
29150	eng	Don't take the trouble to come and meet me.
29151	eng	Thank you for coming all the way to see me.
29152	eng	Thank you very much for driving me all the way to my house.
29153	eng	Do not bother to come to my home.
29154	eng	Don't bother to pick me up at the hotel.
29155	eng	How good of you to come all the way to see me off!
29156	eng	Thank you for coming all the way to see me off.
29158	eng	Don't bother to come to my house.
29159	eng	Don't ask me why.
29160	eng	I've got a pain in my side.
29161	eng	Our combined fleet broke through the enemy's defense zone.
29163	eng	Our fighters averaged 430 missions a day.
29164	eng	Abide with me.
29165	eng	Our company has come a long way since it was set up.
29166	eng	Our company is planning to build a new chemical plant in Russia.
29167	eng	Our company wants to take part in that research project.
29168	eng	We made a contract with the firm.
29169	eng	Our personnel are very highly educated.
29170	eng	We have cut back production by 20%.
29171	eng	There is no mother who doesn't love her own child.
29172	eng	We do business with the United States.
29173	eng	We depend on foreign nations for our natural resources.
29174	eng	Our country abounds in products.
29175	eng	Our country is in a crisis.
29176	eng	Our country is rich in marine products.
29177	eng	Our country has enjoyed many years of unbroken peace.
29178	eng	Our country is running short of energy resources.
29179	eng	We import tea from India.
29180	eng	Our cities create serious pollution problems.
29181	eng	Crime is certainly on the increase in many of our big cities.
29182	eng	Our tax system is still without coherent philosophy.
29183	eng	The morals of our politicians have been corrupted.
29184	eng	The chief crop of our country is rice.
29185	eng	The gross national product of our country is the second largest.
29186	eng	Our people thirst for independence.
29187	eng	I was extremely disappointed to see our national soccer team suffer a historic loss.

31172	eng	Here it's August and our summer vacation is nearly over.
31173	eng	It's out of stock, but I can give you a rain check.
31174	eng	Have you written all the New Year's cards already?
31175	eng	I feel my age.
31176	eng	Never again would she be curious about the city.
31177	eng	Never again would she want to live there.
31178	eng	You should not take to drinking again.
31179	eng	I've decided not to keep a dog again.
31180	eng	You had better not go there again.
31181	eng	Never be this late again.
31182	eng	You will be able to speak fluent English in another few months.
31183	eng	It's time you stood on your own two feet.
31184	eng	Have you worked out the answer yet?
31186	eng	I've got to hang up now. Someone is waiting to use the phone.
31187	eng	It is about time we bought a new microwave oven.
31188	eng	I haven't seen her for ages.
31189	eng	I'm beat. I've been working from dawn to dusk.
31190	eng	Have you eaten lunch yet?
31191	eng	I have already eaten lunch.
31192	eng	Have you eaten your lunch yet?
31193	eng	It's getting late. I don't wanna go home alone.
31194	eng	Seeing that it is late, we should go home.
31195	eng	It's late.
31196	eng	It's getting late, so we'd better get going.
31197	eng	As it is late, turn off the TV.
31198	eng	We'd better roll now.
31199	eng	Now that the weather is warmer, I can go outdoors.
31200	eng	No one trusts him any more.
31202	eng	Now that you are grown-up, it is up to you to decide what to do.
31203	eng	It's OK now. Don't worry. You can depend on me one hundred percent.
31204	eng	Now that you're a college student, you should study harder.
31205	eng	Now that you are a college student, you should know better.
31206	eng	Now you are a big boy, behave yourself.
31208	eng	I can't wait any more.
31209	eng	I don't feel like waiting any longer.
31210	eng	It is time my son came home from school.
31211	eng	We think that there should be no more wars.
31212	eng	You won't catch me doing that again.
31213	eng	It's already cleared up.
31214	eng	I have been reading this for a few hours.
31215	eng	It's high time you got married and settled down.
31216	eng	Now there is neither God nor Buddha.
31217	eng	Now that you know the truth, perhaps you'll feel better.
31218	eng	Have you done with the paper?
31219	eng	You should get yourself a new car now.
31220	eng	It's time to go to bed.
31221	eng	It's time to go to bed. Turn off the radio.
31222	eng	It's time you went to bed.
31223	eng	It is time to go to bed.
31224	eng	I will hit the sack.
31226	eng	It's high time you were in bed.
31228	eng	Now that we have eaten, let's go.
31229	eng	May I start eating now?
31230	eng	I could not eat another bite.
31231	eng	I can't eat any more.
31232	eng	I am already accustomed to sitting on tatami.
31233	eng	It's time to get aboard.
31234	eng	I want to sleep a little more.
31235	eng	Take things a little more seriously.
31236	eng	I wish I were a little taller.
31237	eng	Rack your brains a little harder.
31238	eng	As he gets older, your son will grow more independent.
31239	eng	With a little more patience, you could have succeeded.
31240	eng	With a little more effort, he would have succeeded.
31241	eng	A little more effort, and you will succeed.
31243	eng	Can't you stay a little longer?
31244	eng	With a little more care, the driver could have avoided such a tragic accident.
31245	eng	I should have paid a little more attention.
31246	eng	With a little more care, you would have succeeded.
31247	eng	With a little more wisdom, he would not have got in trouble.
31248	eng	A little louder.
31249	eng	Don't you have another one that's a little larger?
31250	eng	Could you give me a few more minutes?
31251	eng	You may as well wait for a while. It'll clear up soon.
31252	eng	Had you come a little earlier, you could have met her.
31253	eng	Had they left a little earlier, they would have avoided the traffic jam.
31254	eng	If I had left a little earlier, I would have caught the last train.
31255	eng	If you had left a little earlier, you would have avoided the heavy traffic.
31256	eng	If you had left home a little earlier you would have been in time.
31257	eng	Move forward one step.
31258	eng	Do you think you could make a little less noise?
31259	eng	Give me a little more water.
31260	eng	You could have solved this puzzle with a little more patience.
31261	eng	Would you explain it in more detail?
31262	eng	Please turn down the volume a little bit more.
31263	eng	Do you have one a little smaller?
31264	eng	Would you like some more?
31265	eng	May I ask you some more questions?
31266	eng	Put in a little more sugar.
31268	eng	I'll think about it.
31269	eng	I think I'll look around a little more.
31270	eng	Can I have some more milk?
31271	eng	I wish I had a better memory.
31272	eng	Can you hold on a little longer?
31273	eng	I want you to straighten up the environment a little more.
31276	eng	If she had been a little more patient, she could have succeeded.
31277	eng	If you had been a little more patient, you could have succeeded.
31278	eng	If you had been a little more patient, you would have succeeded.
31279	eng	Would you like to turn it down a little?
31280	eng	A little heavier rain might cause a flood.
31281	eng	A little more to the right, just like so!
31282	eng	We would have bought the plane tickets if the price had been a little lower.
31283	eng	Can you give me a discount?
31284	eng	Can't you bring down the price a bit?
31285	eng	Do you have a cheaper room?
31286	eng	Do you have a room that's a little cheaper?
31287	eng	Could you give me a better price?
31288	eng	Turn the radio down a little.
31290	eng	Please speak a little more slowly.
31292	eng	Would you speak more slowly, please?
31293	eng	Would you mind speaking more slowly?
31295	eng	I think we should do some more.
31296	eng	Why don't you try expressing your opinion a little more gently? Think about how he feels getting told flatly that he's being cut loose.
31297	eng	Put some more wood on the fire.
31298	eng	Would you like some more beef?
31299	eng	Just a little more patience.
31300	eng	I'd like some more bread, please.
31301	eng	I almost got a perfect score.
31303	eng	I almost forgot it.
31304	eng	I barely escaped being hit by the truck.
31305	eng	It is almost 12 o'clock.
31306	eng	Would you like some more salad?
31307	eng	Add a little more pepper.
31308	eng	Won't you have some more coffee?
31310	eng	Will you have some more cake?
31311	eng	Would you like some more cake?
31312	eng	If you had made more effort, you would have passed the entrance examination.
31313	eng	Can I have some more tea?
31315	eng	I should think we will need some more money.
31316	eng	We could have bought the car with a little more money.
31317	eng	Why don't you stay a little while?
31318	eng	Could you speak a little louder please?
31319	eng	You must put some life into your work.
31320	eng	The jig is up; let's face the music like men.
31321	eng	I gave up all hope of survival.
31323	eng	I guess we should leave now.
31324	eng	Can I leave now?
31325	eng	I may as well go now.
31326	eng	You had better not go out now. It's almost 11.
31327	eng	Have you handed in your homework?
31328	eng	Have you finished your homework yet?
31329	eng	Have you finished your homework already?
31331	eng	Have you finished your homework?
31332	eng	Would you mind waiting another ten minutes?
31333	eng	I have had more than enough.
31334	eng	Time is up.
31335	eng	Are you through yet?
31336	eng	Have you finished already?
31337	eng	Have you finished yet?
31339	eng	It's on its last legs.
31340	eng	It's time to work now. Let's get down to business.
31341	eng	The damage is done.
31342	eng	Have you washed your hands yet?
31343	eng	My hand's getting too cold.
31344	eng	I weep for my lost youth.
31345	eng	He's no spring chicken.
31346	eng	May I be excused?
31347	eng	It's 7:30 now. I must fly.
31348	eng	We have no time.
31349	eng	Now that we're alone, let's have fun.
31350	eng	Don't regard me as your father anymore.
31351	eng	I will make it clear that I won't come again.
31352	eng	Now that I'm a grownup, I think otherwise.
31353	eng	Now I can look after myself.
31354	eng	It is time for me to take a vacation.
31356	eng	I've made up my mind.
31357	eng	Please don't write letters to me anymore.
31358	eng	It's time for us to go home.
31360	eng	I'd better get going. My father is really strict.
31361	eng	There's no need to cry like a child.
31362	eng	Since you are no longer a child, you should be responsible for what you do.
31363	eng	Since you are no longer a child, you are to take care of yourself.
31364	eng	It is time you left off your childish ways.
31365	eng	It's high time the children went to bed.
31366	eng	I've already finished my work.
31368	eng	Now I must go about my work.
31369	eng	It's time you went to the barber's.
31370	eng	I think we had better wait another thirty minutes.
31371	eng	The matter was settled.
31375	eng	My age is going to tell on me.
31376	eng	Have you read today's paper yet?
31377	eng	It was really good.
31379	eng	I am feeling much better now.
31380	eng	I have to leave now.
31381	eng	I have got to go now.
31382	eng	I've got to leave soon.
31383	eng	It's high time to go. See you later.
31384	eng	I must leave now.
31385	eng	Got to go now.
31386	eng	We have our backs to the wall.
31387	eng	I'll say no more.
31389	eng	I don't want to hear any more excuses.
31390	eng	No, thank you.
31391	eng	Let's patch up our argument.
31392	eng	Have you arrived at a decision yet?
31393	eng	It is time you put a stop to this nonsense.
31394	eng	Now that you are a high school student, you are responsible for what you do.
31395	eng	I'm fed up with always backing you up.
31396	eng	You had better hurry because the banks will close soon.
31397	eng	Let's be done with the argument.
31398	eng	Let's not argue anymore.
31399	eng	This is the time you should get up.
31400	eng	It's time we went home.
31401	eng	It's about time you got up.
31402	eng	Can I go home now?
31403	eng	You can go home now.
31404	eng	It's already time to go home.
31405	eng	Hadn't we better be going now?
31406	eng	I'd better be on my way.
31407	eng	I guess I'll have to leave now.
31409	eng	Will you permit us to leave now?
31410	eng	You may as well go home now.
31411	eng	I don't have to wear glasses any more.
31412	eng	I fear we are too late.
31414	eng	I have had enough of sweets.
31415	eng	It is time to go to school.
31416	eng	This is the last straw!
31417	eng	I can't take this anymore. I've lost my temper completely.
31418	eng	I can't take it any more.
31419	eng	I can't stand it anymore.
31420	eng	It's all over for you.
31422	eng	You'd better go home now.
31423	eng	May I go home now?
31424	eng	You'd better go back home now.
31425	eng	How many times are you going to make me say it? Do you know how many times I've tried to wake you up?
31426	eng	I'm sure that family is familiar with Japanese tastes in food. They've hosted quite a few Japanese exchange students.
31427	eng	It already has taken me hours.
31428	eng	Have you decided what to do yet?
31430	eng	That was hard to believe.
31431	eng	We have had enough of rain.
31433	eng	Now that it has stopped raining, we can go home.
31434	eng	Let's turn and go back now.
31435	eng	Please take another one.
31436	eng	With just a little more effort, he would have succeeded.
31437	eng	Another step, and you will fall down the precipice.
31438	eng	Another step, and you'll fall over the cliff.
31439	eng	I'm done up.
31440	eng	Another step, and you would have fallen down the stairs.
31441	eng	You're lit up like a Christmas tree.
31442	eng	Let's have one more drink, and then I'll take you back home.
31443	eng	Will you have another glass of wine?
31444	eng	Will you have another cup of milk?
31445	eng	Would you care for another glass of beer?
31446	eng	I feel like another beer.
31447	eng	Would you mind my drinking another cup of coffee?
31448	eng	Won't you have another cup of coffee?
31449	eng	Give me another cup of tea.
31450	eng	Would you have another cup of tea?
31451	eng	Will you have another cup of tea?
31452	eng	I'd like to stay another night if I can.
31453	eng	Have patience for another day or two.
31454	eng	Stick to it!
31455	eng	Another storm, and our village would have been ruined.
31456	eng	Set your translation against the original once again.
31457	eng	I want to climb Mt. Fuji again.
31458	eng	I'll see him again.
31459	eng	If I visit Nara again, I will have visited it four times.
31460	eng	May I put it on again?
31461	eng	Please send me another copy.
31462	eng	Another war, and we all will be killed.
31463	eng	Another war, and we will be ruined.
31464	eng	Explain it once more, Jerry.
31465	eng	Would you explain it again?
31466	eng	We tried again to bump off the politician, but couldn't do it.
31468	eng	Would that I were young again.
31469	eng	Had he tried it once more, he would have succeeded in it.
31470	eng	I tried it again, only to fail.
31471	eng	Will you let me try once more?
31472	eng	Read it once more, please.
31476	eng	Could you repeat that, please?
31477	eng	Pardon me?
31478	eng	I would like to talk with you again.
31479	eng	Another mistake, and he will be fired.
31480	eng	I propose that we should have another meeting.
31481	eng	Could you please repeat it slowly?
31482	eng	I'd think twice about this.
31483	eng	You must encourage him to try again.
31484	eng	Let's try again.
31486	eng	It is no use trying again.
31487	eng	Could I ask you to do that again?
31488	eng	I tried again for no reason.
31489	eng	Can I have the menu again, please?
31490	eng	Give me a second chance.
31491	eng	Give me another chance.
31492	eng	Should he be given another chance, he would do his best.
31493	eng	I will lend you money just this once.
31494	eng	Read it once more.
31495	eng	We tried it again, but couldn't do it.
31496	eng	Please show it to me again.
31497	eng	Try it once again.
31498	eng	Do it a second time.
31500	eng	I tried it over again.
31501	eng	Why don't you give it another try?
31502	eng	I want to go there once more.
31503	eng	If I read this book once more, I shall have read it three times.
31504	eng	We hope to see you again.
31505	eng	We hope to meet you again.
31506	eng	Do it again!
31507	eng	I beg your pardon; I didn't quite catch your name.
31508	eng	I'm sorry?
31511	eng	I am anxious to visit Britain once again.
31512	eng	I want to see them again.
31513	eng	We are looking forward to serving you again.
31514	eng	We are looking forward to seeing you again.
31515	eng	Surely he can not enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!
31516	eng	Make one more effort, and you will succeed.
31517	eng	It's getting there.
31518	eng	One more effort, you will get on in life.
31520	eng	Let's try once again.
31521	eng	"I can't even make a crane," she said to herself.
31522	eng	Please show me another one.
31523	eng	Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be recovered from radioactive waste material.
31524	eng	It was very wise of her to choose the other one.
31525	eng	The other committee consists of four members.
31526	eng	I think I will have one more ice cream cone.
31527	eng	May I have another piece of cake?
31528	eng	Would you like another piece of cake?
31529	eng	I have just one more thing to ask of you - get lost.
31530	eng	It is already dark.
31531	eng	Cut that out. You're just rubbing salt in the poor guy's wounds.
31533	eng	You are old enough to know better. Behave yourself.
31534	eng	Have you gotten yourselves acquainted?
31535	eng	It is high time I was going.
31536	eng	You should be a thought more careful.
31537	eng	This guy is really wishy-washy. He couldn't make a decision to save his life.
31539	eng	I'd better go to bed now.
31540	eng	One more effort, and you will get on in life.
31541	eng	Another lot of tourists arrived.
31542	eng	The other grasped his arm.
31543	eng	Try on another one.
31544	eng	Another thing that is required is a dictionary.
31545	eng	Make one more effort and you will reach the summit.
31546	eng	I'm sick and tired of hamburgers.
31547	eng	One more effort, and you will succeed.
31548	eng	No more parties.
31549	eng	Have you applied for a passport yet?
31550	eng	It is time you went to bed. Turn off the radio.
31551	eng	How long have you been living in Tokyo?
31552	eng	How long have you been living out of a suitcase?
31553	eng	It is high time we went to bed.
31554	eng	How long have you looked after this rose garden?
31555	eng	It's high time you left for school, isn't it?
31556	eng	I can't study anywhere in my house. It's too noisy.
31557	eng	There is no more room for a TV set.
31558	eng	It's about time you stopped watching television.
31559	eng	We could have our tea in the garden, were it a little warmer.
31560	eng	It's just a little further.
31561	eng	You could try and be a bit more civilized.
31562	eng	With a little more patience, you could succeed.
31563	eng	How about adding a little bit more salt?
31564	eng	How about another round?
31565	eng	I almost drowned.
31566	eng	Could you please speak a little bit more slowly?
31567	eng	Almost.
31568	eng	Do you want to stay any longer?
31569	eng	I need some get-up-and-go.
31570	eng	I have had it.
31571	eng	That's too much.
31572	eng	It's about time for the train to arrive.
31574	eng	It's about time to start.
31575	eng	It's about time you settled down for good.
31576	eng	It is about time we were leaving.
31577	eng	It's about time to go to school.
31578	eng	It is about time you stopped being so idle and did some work.
31579	eng	I saw him no more.
31580	eng	Well, I have to be going.
31581	eng	Let's not talk about it any more.
31582	eng	That will do.
31583	eng	I cannot put up with the noise any longer.
31584	eng	Have you already met Mr Smith?
31585	eng	There's nothing there.
31586	eng	It's the dead of the night.
31587	eng	It looks as if autumn is really here.
31588	eng	With a little more effort.
31590	eng	I was nearly hit by a car.
31591	eng	Had I had a little more money, I would have bought it.
31593	eng	It'll soon be time for dinner.
31594	eng	Day will break soon.
31597	eng	It will not be long before he gets well.
31599	eng	Winter is drawing on.
31600	eng	The rainy season is near at hand.
31601	eng	It's nearly lunchtime. Why don't we stop to have a bite to eat?
31602	eng	It will get warmer soon.
31603	eng	The sun will come up soon.
31604	eng	Spring will come soon.
31605	eng	It won't be long before everything is ready.
31606	eng	My birthday is coming soon.
31607	eng	We are going to have a baby.
31609	eng	I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
31610	eng	You will be allowed to go out soon.
31611	eng	Soon there will be summer vacation.
31612	eng	There is an athletic meet soon.
31613	eng	It's almost rush hour.
31614	eng	It is going to rain very soon.
31615	eng	I'll soon finish reading this novel.
31616	eng	Everyone will have his own computer before long.
31617	eng	We're getting out of here in a moment.
31618	eng	It will soon be New Year.

32487	eng	Mummy has to do the washing this afternoon.
32488	eng	Mummy cried.
32489	eng	Mom didn't mention it.
32490	eng	Mummy, who's terrified of mice, had two fears to cope with.
32491	eng	All her years of work and effort have gone up in flames.
32492	eng	You helped Mommy?
32493	eng	You'll catch it from Mummy.
32494	eng	Mummy and I moved into the hall.
32495	eng	Mommy, where's my booger?
32496	eng	Mum, why doesn't Dad clean his own study?
32497	eng	My eyelid feels hot.
32498	eng	The Mafia uses legitimate business operations as a front.
32499	eng	As quick as a wink.
32500	eng	The manager complimented him on his achievement.
32501	eng	The manager threw in the towel in defeat and planned how to win the next game.
32502	eng	The manager blamed himself for the failure.
32503	eng	The manager deals with many problems.
32504	eng	The manager suggested that I go with him to the airport.
32505	eng	Some managers murmured at his appointment as president.
32506	eng	Can you operate a manual transmission?
32507	eng	Madonna is a beauty.
32508	eng	Madonna is known to every high school student in Japan.
32509	eng	Madonna's concert drew a large audience.
32510	eng	I'll bet Madonna doesn't return to her career for awhile.
32511	eng	You've got to get a steady job.
32512	eng	Why don't you get yourself a decent house?
32513	eng	I'd like to live in a decent house.
32514	eng	May I wash all my laundry at once?
32515	eng	Could you knock down the price if I buy two?

32517	eng	Matt is a powerful acquisition for our team.
32518	eng	Wipe your shoes on the mat.
32519	eng	Let's get together and talk it over.
32520	eng	You can put five of them across the head of a match.
32521	eng	Be careful handling matches!
32522	eng	Have you got a match?
32523	eng	Put the matches out of reach of children.
32524	eng	He felt for his matches and found them in his back pocket.
32525	eng	Do you have a match?
32526	eng	It is quite a sorry sight.
32527	eng	I agree completely.
32528	eng	You are quite right.
32529	eng	Quite by chance, I met my old friend at the airport.
32530	eng	It's really horrible.
32532	eng	I wrote to him for quite another reason.
32533	eng	It was a complete failure.
32534	eng	Everything's a little crazy right now.
32535	eng	Look straight ahead.
32536	eng	Climbing the Matterhorn is difficult.
32537	eng	Look forward, please.
32538	eng	Go straight ahead and you will find it. You can't miss it.

32546	eng	Mac is loved by everyone.
32547	eng	Mac knows how to use this computer.
32548	eng	Max is clever with his fingers.
32549	eng	Max explained to Julie why he could not go to her farewell party.
32550	eng	Max looked into the mirror all the time he was talking.
32551	eng	It makes no difference to me that Max has come.
32552	eng	It is me that is wrong.
32553	eng	Excuse me for opening your letter by mistake.
32554	eng	I'll bet my bottom dollar he'll succeed.
32555	eng	He's still fibrillating.
32556	eng	The line is busy again.
32557	eng	See you next week!
32558	eng	Please come again.
32559	eng	I hope you will call again.
32560	eng	I began to sing when I was a youngster.
32561	eng	He hasn't been proven guilty yet.
32562	eng	There are still barbarous nations.
32563	eng	There were still no visual signs of spring.
32565	eng	The baby doesn't walk yet.
32566	eng	You must keep this plan a secret as there may be some changes yet.
32567	eng	For others, it is a vision of what could be.
32568	eng	Let's play chess another time.
32569	eng	I don't know yet.
32570	eng	Seeing that he is still sick, he is unlikely to come today.
32571	eng	He is still on his back.
32572	eng	Nor was he ever known to curse unless against the government.
32573	eng	As yet he has not succeeded.
32574	eng	It is silly of me to have made the same mistake twice.
32575	eng	My head still felt giddy.
32576	eng	Don't hang up yet, please.
32577	eng	But I'm not able to use the telephone.
32578	eng	I'll call him later.
32579	eng	I haven't eaten lunch yet.
32580	eng	Some of the luggage hasn't arrived yet.
32581	eng	Nobody has come up yet.
32582	eng	No one has been convicted of the crime yet.
32583	eng	Somebody has let you down again.
32584	eng	I can't stand to take another university entrance exam!
32585	eng	Your heart's still beating loud and clear.
32586	eng	I think I'm putting on weight again.
32587	eng	I'll gain weight again!
32588	eng	My foot's asleep again!
32589	eng	I should sell it while it still runs.
32590	eng	I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
32591	eng	The full story was yet to be told.
32592	eng	What would you do if another war occurred?
32593	eng	We have a long way to go.
32594	eng	Are you still collecting stamps?
32595	eng	You're not excused from the table.
32597	eng	The night is still young.
32598	eng	I understand it's going to get hot again.
32599	eng	I haven't finished my homework yet.
32600	eng	I don't know my address yet, I'm going to stay with my friend for a while.
32601	eng	I hope we can get together again. Yes, I'll be looking forward to it.
32602	eng	Let's get together again.
32603	eng	You drank alcohol again? I told you not to!
32605	eng	I haven't had a reply to my letter.
32606	eng	We still have plenty of time left.
32608	eng	There is yet time.
32610	eng	He suddenly hung up the phone while I was speaking.
32611	eng	Sit down again, Miss Curtis.
32612	eng	There you go again.
32613	eng	Is there still any sugar?
32614	eng	I think I'll come back later.
32615	eng	Another problem has arisen.
32616	eng	I'll call again later.
32619	eng	The decision was still in the air.
32620	eng	I haven't made up my mind sufficiently enough to agree with you.
32621	eng	I haven't decided yet, but I prefer flying to going by train.
32622	eng	I haven't decided yet, but I'll let you know by the time we leave.
32623	eng	I haven't made up my mind yet.
32624	eng	Haven't you decided yet?
32625	eng	There were several rooms still vacant.
32627	eng	I hope I'll see you again soon.
32628	eng	I'm still on duty.
32629	eng	It's still too early to get up.
32630	eng	My hopes revived.
32631	eng	I'm not strong enough yet to go to school.
32632	eng	Will you let me see you again?
32633	eng	Let's get together again!
32634	eng	Glad to see you again.
32635	eng	See you again.
32636	eng	Nice to see you again!
32637	eng	We have more music coming up, so stay tuned.
32639	eng	I'm not good at speaking English yet.
32640	eng	They say we're going to get some rain later.
32642	eng	It is likely to rain again.
32643	eng	It's still raining.
32644	eng	Is it still raining?
32645	eng	The doctors tell you that your brother will never wake up again.
32646	eng	Then John gave this testimony.
32648	eng	Drop me a line.
32649	eng	It looks like they are at it again.
32650	eng	You're still green.
32651	eng	Are you going to play tricks on me again, you naughty boy?
32652	eng	Let's do it another time.
32653	eng	How nice to be in Hawaii again!
32654	eng	I've never been to Paris.
32655	eng	Let's make it some other time.
32656	eng	I look forward to your next visit.
32657	eng	I am still keeping up my tennis craze.
32658	eng	We're all waiting because there's no news about the test results yet.
32659	eng	I'm still feeling a little homesick and so many things seem strange to me.
32660	eng	No one has shown up as yet, but we're expecting at least 50 students.
32661	eng	We still have plenty of time.
32662	eng	You've got plenty of time.
32663	eng	Oh, come on.
32664	eng	It is said that nobody has solved the problem yet.
32665	eng	Are you still around?
32666	eng	I haven't put on the jacket yet.
32667	eng	The time is yet to come.
32668	eng	I haven't had a chance to see the movie yet.
32669	eng	On the other hand we learned a great deal from the experience.
32670	eng	I'm afraid the time is not yet ripe for it.
32671	eng	Do come again.
32672	eng	See you soon!
32673	eng	Until next time.
32674	eng	I must warn you that if you do this again you will be punished.
32675	eng	The line is still busy.
32676	eng	I am looking forward to seeing you again.
32677	eng	I hope to see you again.
32679	eng	It is nice to see you again.
32682	eng	Please keep in touch.
32683	eng	If you're still hungry, have another hamburger.
32684	eng	Do you still need tea?
32685	eng	It is foolish of him to pay for it again.
32686	eng	We are looking forward to seeing you.
32687	eng	I trust that I can see you again.
32688	eng	Nice to see you.
32689	eng	I hope we'll see each other again sometime.
32690	eng	See you around.
32692	eng	If you haven't driven a bike yet, you should give it a shot.
32693	eng	The engine has broken down again.
32695	eng	Any time.
32696	eng	The engine came back to life.
32697	eng	I'll call you some other time.
32698	eng	I hope to see you sometime.
32699	eng	I would like to see you again sometime.
32700	eng	If we have the chance, let's get together on another occasion.
32701	eng	I hear you are still associating with him.
32702	eng	We're looking forward to seeing you again.
32703	eng	I've come to talk with you again.
32704	eng	I look forward to seeing you again.
32706	eng	I'll see you later.
32707	eng	Not again! Look at those two kissing. They've really got the hots for each other. I can't watch this any more.
32708	eng	Another day passed.
32709	eng	She must still be in her twenties.
32710	eng	Though she was only twelve years old, Susan knew how to make a living.
32711	eng	Again? Not again!
32712	eng	They asked him.
32714	eng	Also, a lot of houses were damaged; windows were often broken throughout the town.
32715	eng	Also, if you manufacture any other products, please send information.
32716	eng	I'm not ready yet.
32717	eng	May I take a rain check?
32718	eng	Maybe next time!
32719	eng	I haven't decided yet.
32720	eng	Also, increased temperatures may require that lubricants be changed frequently.
32721	eng	I'd like you to put me back on the list.
32722	eng	I have not finished the task yet.
32723	eng	And even outside these nations, English is perhaps more widely used as a medium of international communication than any other language.
32724	eng	Uh-oh, here comes another lecture. How typical. This guy has something to say about everything.
32725	eng	He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.
32726	eng	But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people and needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man.
32727	eng	I still haven't thanked you for the other day. I really appreciate it.
32728	eng	Also, "armchair shopping" gets rid of the frustrations of crowds and traffic.
32729	eng	I can still hear your voice.
32730	eng	First, I should hear both sides.
32731	eng	First beat the eggs and add them to the soup.

32749	eng	In the first place, you all have to pay a debt first.
32750	eng	To begin with, you have no right to be here.
32751	eng	Originally the meeting was planned for next Saturday.
32752	eng	First of all, we have to finish the homework.
32753	eng	First of all, it is too expensive.
32754	eng	To begin with, that kind of work is too tough for me.
32755	eng	To start with, who is that man?
32756	eng	To begin with, you must be honest.
32757	eng	To begin with, you must know yourself.
32758	eng	In the first place, we have to decide on the name.
32759	eng	I must finish this work first.
32760	eng	First of all, you must look it up in the dictionary.
32761	eng	In the first place, fashions change very quickly.
32762	eng	To begin with, we must tackle the problem.
32763	eng	To begin with, the funds are not sufficient for running a grocery store.
32764	eng	At first they think they won't come to harm, although no smoker escapes at least the short-term effects.
32765	eng	To begin with, you must build up your body.
32766	eng	Let's take your temperature first.
32767	eng	First thrive and then take a wife.
32768	eng	I'll take attendance first.
32769	eng	Tend to your own affairs first.
32770	eng	Let's start the ball rolling by introducing ourselves.
32771	eng	The first subject that attracted my attention was philosophy.
32772	eng	I'll begin by introducing myself.
32773	eng	Please let me speak first.
32774	eng	We must finish our homework first.
32775	eng	The first thing you have to take into consideration is time.
32776	eng	We should determine what is to be done first.
32777	eng	First of all, I will read this.
32778	eng	First of all, let's look at this famous picture.
32779	eng	First of all, I must say this.
32780	eng	You will have little trouble.
32781	eng	First, catch your hare, then cook him.
32782	eng	Physically impossible.
32783	eng	Marry first and love will follow.
32784	eng	First you have to build up your vocabulary.
32785	eng	First we'll hit Kyoto.
32786	eng	It's getting warmer and warmer.
32787	eng	First came the Celts in 600 B.C.
32789	eng	More and more people are moving to urban areas.
32790	eng	More and more people offered to help.
32791	eng	More and more people are becoming aware of the dangers of smoking.
32792	eng	More and more people are rushing to make use of the interactive nature of the medium.
32793	eng	Fires are less frightening today than they once were, because more and more houses are built of concrete, and concrete houses do not burn as easily as the old wooden ones.
32794	eng	More and more doctors have begun to use the new medicine.
32795	eng	Ever louder voices of protest drowned out his speech.
32796	eng	First of all, we have to put your design to the test.
32797	eng	I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
32798	eng	You have to think of the example you're setting. You'll never be able to lead if you don't set an example worth following.
32799	eng	First of all, learn the formula by heart.
32800	eng	Let's decide together where to go first.
32801	eng	Where would you like to go first?
32802	eng	The mast broke and our ship went adrift.
32803	eng	I'd like to have mustard on the side.
32804	eng	Easy on the mustard.
32805	eng	We have to clear up the problem first.
32806	eng	That's about it.
32807	eng	Please beat the rug, first.
32808	eng	We will first ascertain the cause of the disaster.
32809	eng	First of all, you should talk it over with your parents.
32810	eng	The media blew the whole thing out of proportion.
32811	eng	The papers found lots of monkey business when they investigated the Recruit scandal.
32812	eng	I want to eat some cake first.

32826	eng	Masaru claims that he is innocent.
32827	eng	Masaru wants to join the English Club.
32828	eng	He handled things wonderfully, playing it by ear the whole way. I have to say he did an excellent job.
32829	eng	It's really time something was done.
32830	eng	When I was on the point of leaving London, it began to snow.
32831	eng	The very opposite is the truth.
32832	eng	That is well said.
32833	eng	That very tune reminded me of my adolescence.
32835	eng	Masashi and Takako were at odds with each other over where to spend their vacation.
32836	eng	It was quite possible to buy a house, just as it is in England, provided one gives up the idea of buying a home one likes, and at a reasonable price.
32837	eng	Masako finished high school in Japan and then graduated from Harvard.
32838	eng	I hardly think she'd do that.
32839	eng	He was the last person I expected to see.

32841	eng	A friend in need is a friend indeed.
32842	eng	You must provide for a rainy day.
32843	eng	He insured himself for a rainy day.
32844	eng	Save for a rainy day.
32845	eng	You should always save money for a rainy day.
32846	eng	You should save some money against a rainy day.
32847	eng	You should lay by something against a rainy day.
32848	eng	Please push this button at once in case of emergency.

32855	eng	I will not go to the length of saying such things.
32856	eng	You are the last person I expected to see here.
32857	eng	That wouldn't be the house we're looking for, surely.
32858	eng	You must be kidding!
32860	eng	It's not likely that he went there.
32861	eng	Masao won't come here, will he?
32862	eng	Mother Teresa was given the Nobel prize.

33482	eng	I don't know, nor do I care.
33483	eng	I'm about ready.
33484	eng	I go to bed very early.
33485	eng	I don't like to speak in public.
33486	eng	As a boy I used to lie on my back on the grass and look at the white clouds.
33487	eng	I'm a little angry with you.
33488	eng	I have no time to put my books in order before I go.
33489	eng	I neither drink nor smoke.
33490	eng	I am an eager student of magic.
33492	eng	I can easily touch my toes.
33493	eng	I will never go out of my way.
33494	eng	I have half a mind to see that myself.
33495	eng	I have a great mind to do that myself.
33496	eng	I don't see why I am in a bad humor this morning.
33497	eng	Yesterday I ran into Yamada, whom I hadn't seen in years.
33498	eng	I was laughed at in school today.
33499	eng	I am so full of foolish ideas today.
33500	eng	I have gone astray somewhere in my calculations.
33501	eng	I will take you for a swim.
33502	eng	I don't believe you. You're always telling lies.
33503	eng	I am fed up with your nonsense.
33504	eng	I am no younger than you are.
33505	eng	I will go between you and your father.
33506	eng	I put on an air of interest.
33507	eng	I used to keep a diary in English when I was a student.
33508	eng	I walked the whole way to the station.
33509	eng	I am going to put my heart into the work.
33510	eng	In my opinion he is not fit for the work.

33514	eng	I meet him on occasion at the club.
33515	eng	I was at my wit's end as to how to act.
33517	eng	I will not let the story go out.
33518	eng	I will try it again.
33519	eng	I remember it as if it were yesterday, but in reality it was fifteen years ago.
33520	eng	I have no knowledge of that question.
33521	eng	I have to assign more men to that work.
33522	eng	I went through my money in a very short time.
33523	eng	I had my composition corrected by Mr Jones.
33524	eng	I'm feeling fit.
33525	eng	I say this from my heart.
33526	eng	I know nothing but this.
33527	eng	I know only this.
33528	eng	I'm not familiar with this part of the subject.
33529	eng	I am not concerned with this matter.
33530	eng	I came across this book in a secondhand bookstore.
33531	eng	I want to emphasize this point in particular.
33532	eng	I have to keep my mind on this important question.
33533	eng	I will put this business through in a week.
33534	eng	I think this one is inferior to that in quality.
33535	eng	I'm a coward when it comes to cockroaches.
33536	eng	I don't like coffee.
33537	eng	I prefer tea to coffee.
33538	eng	I am interested in getting a hat like this.
33539	eng	I am sure that Jim made up that story.
33540	eng	I will not go to the trouble of taking him there.
33541	eng	That is not my idea of him.
33542	eng	I want some money.
33543	eng	I'm in need of money.
33544	eng	I felt the engine running.
33545	eng	I forgot to lift the receiver before dialing the number.
33546	eng	I keep your interests at heart all the time.
33547	eng	I am quite ready for payment.
33548	eng	I gave up smoking for a year.
33549	eng	I caught sight of her at Shibuya.
33550	eng	I belong to the karate club.
33551	eng	I like tennis very much.
33552	eng	All my efforts proved of no avail.
33553	eng	Don't avoid my question.
33554	eng	My car burns a lot of gas.
33555	eng	My bicycle has a flat tire.
33556	eng	What did you do with my glasses?
33557	eng	My watch stopped working.
33558	eng	My pen isn't as good as yours.
33559	eng	Will you find my contact lens for me?
33560	eng	What have you done with my pen? It was here a minute ago.
33561	eng	Are you still in doubt about what I have said?
33562	eng	Me, I prefer coffee to tea.
33563	eng	Leave my camera alone.
33564	eng	My grandfather goes for a walk on fine days.
33565	eng	My watch gains two minutes a month.
33566	eng	I have nothing to go by.
33567	eng	Well, I have a suggestion to make.
33568	eng	I have no idea why it is so.
33569	eng	He got mad at me for calling him Shorty.
33570	eng	I can't afford to pay so much.
33571	eng	Can you give me some money?
33572	eng	I only have toast and coffee in the morning.
33573	eng	How about going steady with me?
33574	eng	You can come with me.
33575	eng	How about going to see a movie with me?
33576	eng	We are to go on a hike tomorrow.
33577	eng	We may as well wait.
33578	eng	We have to go by the rules.
33579	eng	We went to the park, and we played there.
33580	eng	It's all over between us.
33581	eng	No sooner had we entered the hall than the ceremony began.
33582	eng	I like such sports as boxing and hockey.
33583	eng	I don't like such sports as boxing and hockey.
33584	eng	Boxing is not always a rough sport.
33585	eng	Boxing has been defined as the art of hitting without being hit.
33586	eng	Boxing Day, when presents are given to the postman, the milkman, etc., is the first week-day after Christmas.
33587	eng	The fighter toughened up for the bout.
33588	eng	The boxer had to lose weight for the title match.
33589	eng	Boxers need quick reflexes.
33590	eng	The boxer was hit on the chin and went down for the count.
33591	eng	A boxer and an actor are coming toward us.
33592	eng	What I mean is this.
33593	eng	I will get it for you.
33595	eng	I had him come while I was still in bed.
33596	eng	The reason I'm here is because I was asked to come.
33597	eng	I know a good Italian restaurant.
33598	eng	It's balmy today.
33599	eng	Everything else is fine.
33600	eng	Some other boys came along.
33601	eng	No other man could do my work.
33602	eng	The others have to try and catch the murderer.
33603	eng	You shouldn't count on others for help.
33604	eng	I caught up with the others.
33606	eng	Where are the other girls?
33607	eng	The rest of us all had the smoked salmon.
33608	eng	I don't like other kinds of drinks.
33609	eng	Are you going to visit any other countries?
33611	eng	I had to work hard to keep up with the other students.
33613	eng	Can I see what's on the other channels?
33614	eng	Is there no alternative to your method?
33615	eng	Do you feel pain in any other part of your body?
33616	eng	Is everything OK here?
33617	eng	We agreed that there was no other alternative.
33618	eng	Is anyone else bidding?
33619	eng	There isn't anywhere else to park.
33620	eng	Can I bring you anything else?
33621	eng	Do you have anything else to order?
33622	eng	Was anybody else absent?
33623	eng	Who else came to the party?
33625	eng	There being nothing else to do, we went for a drive.
33626	eng	Who else is gone today?
33627	eng	Throw the ball back to me.
33628	eng	Please throw the ball.
33629	eng	Pass the ball quickly to a person behind you.
33630	eng	They filled them with straw to make them round and hard.
33631	eng	Chuck me the ball.
33632	eng	It is necessary that the halls be well cleaned.
33633	eng	The ballboys and ballgirls all come from local schools.
33634	eng	I have a ball-point pen, but I want another.
33635	eng	My ballpoint pen just ran out of ink.
33636	eng	Fill out the form in ballpoint.
33637	eng	Write with a ballpoint pen.
33638	eng	Will you write with a ballpoint pen?
33639	eng	Paul makes it a rule not to be late for his appointments.
33640	eng	Paul stood with his hand shading his eyes.
33641	eng	The hall was filled to capacity.
33642	eng	Paul went to the party in place of his father.
33643	eng	The ball hit him on the left side of the head.
33644	eng	The ball rolled on the ground towards me.
33645	eng	Paul prefers English to math.
33646	eng	Paul offered a new plan.
33647	eng	Paul put on gloves before going out.
33648	eng	The ball rolled across the lawn.
33649	eng	Paul is punctual like a clock.
33650	eng	Paul made a lot of money last year.
33651	eng	The hall could seat a thousand people before it was partitioned.
33652	eng	Paul studies very hard these days.
33653	eng	The ball bounced high in the air.
33654	eng	Balls are round.
33655	eng	Paul blushed and turned away.
33656	eng	Paul is by far the most charming boy in our school.
33657	eng	Paul's knowledge of creative bookkeeping has been the secret of his ability to get all the staffing he needs.
33658	eng	Paul is not so much a singer as a composer.
33659	eng	What were the balls made of? Thousands of years ago, the Egyptians made balls out of soft leather or cloth.
33660	eng	Paul wasn't with Mary when her purse was stolen.
33661	eng	The ball bounded away into our neighbor's garden.
33663	eng	Paul is so pleasant a person that everybody likes him at once.
33664	eng	That's the way the ball bounces.
33665	eng	Paul didn't become arrogant even though he was rich.
33666	eng	We have no salad in the bowl.
33667	eng	I wonder what happened to Paul.
33668	eng	The number of the chairs in the hall is 80.
33669	eng	More guests have come than the hall can hold.
33670	eng	There's a telephone in the hall.
33671	eng	There was a large crowd in the hall.
33672	eng	There was a small audience in the hall.
33673	eng	There were many people in the hall.
33674	eng	There wasn't a single vacant seat in the hall.
33675	eng	The hall was filled with students, many of whom were girls.
33676	eng	There were plenty of guests in the hall.
33677	eng	There were a fair number of people in the hall.
33678	eng	Paul has three sons. They look very much alike.
33679	eng	I found it a lot of fun to play tennis with Paul.
33680	eng	The ball hit her in the eye.
33681	eng	Not only the balls; the bat was also stolen yesterday.
33682	eng	The ball rolled across the road.
33683	eng	A ball hit her on the right leg.
33684	eng	A ball flew in through the window.
33685	eng	A ball is floating down the river.
33686	eng	Paul's success was a myth.
33687	eng	The ball bounced up high.
33688	eng	I enjoyed the concert except that the hall was cold.
33689	eng	We couldn't figure out what Paul wanted to do.
33690	eng	Hit the ball on the rise.
33691	eng	A hole in one is moving on the whole.
33692	eng	Just once, I'd like to get a hole-in-one some day.
33693	eng	Do you think we'll make it to the airport in time, Paul?
33694	eng	Count me out if you go bowling.
33695	eng	Poland ceased to exist as a nation for 120 years.
33696	eng	Paula is going to wash the car tomorrow.
33697	eng	Paula has to help her father in the kitchen.
